  abstract = {Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) consist of mesh routers and mesh clients,
	where mesh routers have minimal mobility and form the backbone of
	WMNs. They provide network access for both mesh and conventional
	clients. The integration of WMNs with other networks such as the
	Internet, cellular, IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.15, IEEE 802.16, sensor
	networks, etc., can be accomplished through the gateway and bridging
	functions in the mesh routers. Mesh clients can be either stationary
	or mobile, and can form a client mesh network among themselves and
	with mesh routers. WMNs are anticipated to resolve the limitations
	and to significantly improve the performance of ad hoc networks,
	wireless local area networks (WLANs), wireless personal area networks
	(WPANs), and wireless metropolitan area networks (WMANs). They are
	undergoing rapid progress and inspiring numerous deployments. WMNs
	will deliver wireless services for a large variety of applications
	in personal, local, campus, and metropolitan areas. Despite recent
	advances in wireless mesh networking, many research challenges remain
	in all protocol layers. This paper presents a detailed study on recent
	advances and open research issues in WMNs. System architectures and
	applications of WMNs are described, followed by discussing the critical
	factors influencing protocol design. Theoretical network capacity
	and the state-of-the-art protocols for WMNs are explored with an
	objective to point out a number of open research issues. Finally,
	testbeds, industrial practice, and current standard activities related
	to WMNs are highlighted.},

  abstract = {We propose novel cooperative transmission protocols for delay-limited
	coherent fading channels consisting of N (half-duplex and single-antenna)
	partners and one cell site. In our work, we differentiate between
	the relay, cooperative broadcast (down-link), and cooperative multiple-access
	(CMA) (up-link) channels. The proposed protocols are evaluated using
	Zheng-Tse diversity-multiplexing tradeoff. For the relay channel,
	we investigate two classes of cooperation schemes; namely, amplify
	and forward (AF) protocols and decode and forward (DF) protocols.
	For the first class, we establish an upper bound on the achievable
	diversity-multiplexing tradeoff with a single relay. We then construct
	a new AF protocol that achieves this upper bound. The proposed algorithm
	is then extended to the general case with (N-1) relays where it is
	shown to outperform the space-time coded protocol of Laneman and
	Wornell without requiring decoding/encoding at the relays. For the
	class of DF protocols, we develop a dynamic decode and forward (DDF)
	protocol that achieves the optimal tradeoff for multiplexing gains
	0/spl les/r/spl les/1/N. Furthermore, with a single relay, the DDF
	protocol is shown to dominate the class of AF protocols for all multiplexing
	gains. The superiority of the DDF protocol is shown to be more significant
	in the cooperative broadcast channel. The situation is reversed in
	the CMA channel where we propose a new AF protocol that achieves
	the optimal tradeoff for all multiplexing gains. A distinguishing
	feature of the proposed protocols in the three scenarios is that
	they do not rely on orthogonal subspaces, allowing for a more efficient
	use of resources. In fact, using our results one can argue that the
	suboptimality of previously proposed protocols stems from their use
	of orthogonal subspaces rather than the half-duplex constraint.},

  abstract = {A sensible design of wireless networks involves striking a good balance
	between an aggressive reuse of the spectral resource throughout the
	network and managing the resulting co-channel interference. Traditionally,
	this problem has been tackled using a ldquodivide and conquerrdquo
	approach. The latter consists in deploying the network with a static
	or semidynamic pattern of resource reutilization. The chosen reuse
	factor, while sacrificing a substantial amount of efficiency, brings
	the interference to a tolerable level. The resource can then be managed
	in each cell so as to optimize the per cell capacity using an advanced
	air interface design. In this paper, we focus our attention on the
	overall network capacity as a measure of system performance. We consider
	the problem of resource allocation and adaptive transmission in multicell
	scenarios. As a key instance, the problem of joint scheduling and
	power control simultaneously in multiple transmit-receive links,
	which employ capacity-achieving adaptive codes, is studied. In principle,
	the solution of such an optimization hinges on tough issues such
	as the computational complexity and the requirement for heavy receiver-to-transmitter
	feedback and, for cellular networks, cell-to-cell channel state information
	(CSI) signaling. We give asymptotic properties pertaining to rate-maximizing
	power control and scheduling in multicell networks. We then present
	some promising leads for substantial complexity and signaling reduction
	via the use of newly developed distributed and game theoretic techniques.},

  abstract = { Synchronization is considered a particularly difficult task in wireless
	sensor networks due to its decentralized structure. Interestingly,
	synchrony has often been observed in networks of biological agents
	(e.g., synchronously flashing fireflies, or spiking of neurons).
	In this paper, we propose a bio-inspired network synchronization
	protocol for large scale sensor networks that emulates the simple
	strategies adopted by the biological agents. The strategy synchronizes
	pulsing devices that are led to emit their pulses periodically and
	simultaneously. The convergence to synchrony of our strategy follows
	from the theory of Mirollo and Strogatz, 1990, while the scalability
	is evident from the many examples existing in the natural world.
	When the nodes are within a single broadcast range, our key observation
	is that the dependence of the synchronization time on the number
	of nodes N is subject to a phase transition: for values of N beyond
	a specific threshold, the synchronization is nearly immediate; while
	for smaller N, the synchronization time decreases smoothly with respect
	to N. Interestingly, a tradeoff is observed between the total energy
	consumption and the time necessary to reach synchrony. We obtain
	an optimum operating point at the local minimum of the energy consumption
	curve that is associated to the phase transition phenomenon mentioned
	before. The proposed synchronization protocol is directly applied
	to the cooperative reach-back communications problem. The main advantages
	of the proposed method are its scalability and low complexity.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the problem of resource allocation in multiuser single-antenna
	wideband OFDM(A) systems is considered from a cross-layer point of
	view. The main motivation is to show advantages of such systems with
	respect to narrowband systems. Despite the maximum normalized average
	throughput is not increased with respect to that in a narrowband
	system, a more efficient use of resources is possible by considering
	frequency as an additional resource to be allocated. It is shown
	that when the bandwidth is considerably larger than the coherence
	bandwidth of the channel and the channel is varying slowly with respect
	to the scheduling period, average delay can significally be improved.
	In that case, the average delay is only proportional to the scheduling
	period and not to the channel coherence time (as it is the case in
	narrowband systems). Furthermore, different reasource allocation
	policies are analyzed to show average delay improvements when buffer
	occupancy information is used.},

  abstract = {In this correspondence, we present an efficient protocol for the delay-limited
	fading ARQ single relay half-duplex channel. The source is using
	an automatic retransmission request (ARQ) retransmission protocol
	to send data to the relay and the destination. When the relay is
	able to decode, both the relay and the source send the same data
	to the destination providing additional gains. The proposed protocol
	exploits two kinds of diversity: (1) space diversity available through
	the cooperative (relay) terminal, which retransmits the source's
	signals and (2) ARQ diversity obtained by leveraging the retransmission
	delay to enhance the reliability. The performance characterization
	is in terms of the achievable diversity, multiplexing gain and delay
	tradeoff for a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Finally,
	we show the benefits of power control on the diversity by controlling
	the source's power level over the retransmission rounds.},
