0. Introduction
   Google C++ Testing Framework is used for SCOREF-MGMT module's 
   test code.
   
1. Dependencies
   On Ubuntu, libgtest-dev and libgtest0 packages are necessary 
   to link this code against Google's library. Refer to relevant 
   documentation on other systems.
   
   On Ubuntu 12.04, though, you cannot find binary libraries and 
   you have to build them yourself. Do following in order to build
   the binary (this directory is installed by libgtest-dev package)
   
   $ cd /usr/src/gtest
   # sudo cmake .
   # sudo make
   # sudo mv libg* /usr/lib/

2. Building
   In this directory, running make is enough. Please let me know
   if you encounter any compile-time or run-time errors.
    
   $ make

   Be informed that you may have to do 'make clean' before you 
   have an up-to-date binary since test_* files are designated as
   header files and a change in them would not trigger a re-build

3. Running
   In this directory, running the binary created by the compilation
   process is enough. There are no command-line parameters currently.
   
   $ ./TEST-SCOREF-MGMT

4. References
   See Google documentation for further details regarding the test 
   framework,
