The Thread class is used by the resolver (ResolvServer) and running a detached socket (SocketThread). 
When you know some processing will take a long time and will freeze up a socket, there is always the 
possibility to call Detach() on that socket before starting the processing.
When the OnDetached() callback is later called the processing can continue, now in its own thread.
