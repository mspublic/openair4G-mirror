Link level simulations for CONECT project Diamond Relay Network Scenario. 

We assume Half-Duplex relays and a proper scheduling in which two relays never transmit at the same time. 

* relaysim: This file is an extension to dlsim with additional channels created for the second source-relay and relay-destination paths. Relays are AF (Amplify-Forward relays in this simulation). 
* relayQMFsim: Similar to relaysim, except relays are Quantize-Forward relays.
