 
STEP 1: 
install octave package

STEP 2:
It is possible to make OTGplot an executable Octave program by exploiting the ‘#!’ script mechanism. 
Follow these steps:
	1. make OTGplot an executable file (chmod +x OTGplot)
	2. locate your Octave interpreter (which octave)
	3. write such location in the first line of OTGplot (e.g. #! /usr/bin/octave -qf )

Then, you can directly execute OTGplot instead of passing it as argument to octave (e.g. ./OTGplot bitrate.dat 1:4).
If you want to set a title for the plot, you can use the env command: env TITLE="title" OTGplot otg_latency.dat "[1 2]"



STEP 2:
Add OTGplot_path to a user's PATH variable

    PATH=$PATH:/OTGplot_path
    export PATH


NB: Before doing simulation you should delete the following files in the case where they already exist:
rm otg_latency.dat otg.log otg_GP.dat

EXAMPLE :

# env TITLE="GoodPut (Kbis)" OTGplot otg_GP.dat [1:3]
# env TITLE="Radio Access Delay (ms)" OTGplot otg_latency.dat [1:3]
# env TITLE="One Way Delay (ms)" OTGplot otg_latency.dat [1:3]
