This directory contains configuration files and maps for gpsdrive. gpsdrive displays your position and position of others (which are connected to the friends server) on a map. see man gpsdrive and man friendsd2 for details. 

Copy the maps directory to your ~/.gpsdrive directory or merge it with the existing directory iff you have already created other maps.
