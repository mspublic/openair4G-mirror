Proxy Mobile IPv6 - Changelog
==================================================================
Changes in 0.4.2 (9 Nov 2012)
  *Corrected bugs in virtual terminal, enabled at configuration with --enable-vt
  *Check of P flag in PBU.
  *Radius now not mandatory, enabled at configuration with --with-pmip-use-radius
  *Only one type of script per MAG, LMA (before we had a script for MAG1, another one for MAG2, etc)
  *LMA host type is fusionned with HA host type
  *Rename executable from pmip6d to mip6d in order to ease integration of our PMIP stack with the umip project
  *Check that RS or message alerting for an incoming MN comes from the ingress interface
  *Added timer handler for tunnel.
  *Tunnels now can be static or dynamic
  *The alternative of using radius is to create a mapping file (hw address <-> IPv6 W prefix):/etc/pmip/mac-mapping.auth
  *We can put comments in /etc/pmip/mac-mapping.auth file
  *Now 2 MNs attached to the same MAG can communicate between them.
  *Added detection of router sollicitation messages from mobiles (over ethernet and other LTE technologies)

Changes in 0.4.1 (13 Dec 2011):
  *Added Handoff Indicator Option (RFC5213), Access Technology Type Option(RFC5213),
   Mobile Node Identifier Option (RFC 4283) for RFC 5213 PBU/PBA messages.
  *Correction of P and A flag in PBU message (bad endianess issue).
  *Correction and use of automatic padding for options alignment.
  *Removed command line options for PMIP protocol, let only UMIP options, because
   the number of configuration parameters is rather high, so it is preferable to
   use the configuration files.
  *Updated man pages for pmip6d and pmip6d.conf.
  *removed HomeNetworkPrefix and OurAddress entries in LMA and MAG configuration files.

Changes in 0.4 (21 Nov 2011):
  *Now the configuration is inside only one configuration file, for each entity.
   A python script automaticaly parse the configuration file and take the appropriate
   decision for configuring the testbed, there should be no need for modifying this script.
  *Removed hardcoded syslog parse string, now they are located in the configuration files.
  *Now PBU lifetime is smaller (40 seconds instead of 1000 seconds), now the restart
   of this timer works.
  *Now timestamp option is OK in PBU/PBA, but we will improve the processing in next release (windowing).
  *Now sequence numbering of PBU/PBA messages is checked.
  *Added miscellaneous parameters in configuration files, some will be processed in future
   release (RFC5213EnableMAGLocalRouting), RFC5213TimestampBasedApproachInUse should be always
   set to enabled, RFC5213MobileNodeGeneratedTimestampInUse should be always set to disabled.
  *Added traces in case of critical section problems.
  *Added correct type values (RFC 5213) for PBU/PBA message options.
  *Corrected bug of BCE update in LMA: the tunnel was always deleted.
  *Corrected bugs in handlers.
  *Renamed eth_address2hw_address,  hw_address2eth_address to EUI64_to_EUI48, EUI48_to_EUI64
  *Reinforced the test procedure for checking the presence of a mobile on a MAG.
  *Warning, there are some known memory leaks, they will be fixed in next release.

Changes in 0.2 (17 May 2011):
  * Update of README.first, INSTALL, INSTALL.kernel files for the UBUNTU 10.04 LTS version
  * Add of the "Simple_experimentation" directory which contains the drawing and the shell script files to achieve a 1 LMA + 2 MAGs testbed.
  * Update of the /etc/match content file format

Changes in 0.1 (23 Oct 2010):
