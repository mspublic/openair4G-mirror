Received 25 October 2004
From: Robert Barr <rbarr@cisco.com>

This statement updates the IPR statement filed by Cisco on June 20, 2003 for
draft-ietf-nemo-basic-support-00.txt.

Cisco is the owner of US Patent No. 6,636,498 and at least one pending
patent application
relating to the subject matter of draft-ietf-nemo-basic-support-03.txt
"Network Mobility (NEMO) Basic Support Protocol" .
If a standard relating to this subject matter is adopted by IETF and any
claims
of any issued Cisco patents are necessary for practicing this standard, any
party will be able to obtain a license from Cisco to use any such patent
claims under openly specified, reasonable, non-discriminatory terms, with
reciprocity, to implement and fully comply with the standard.

The reasonable non-discriminatory terms are:

If this standard is adopted, Cisco will not assert any patents owned or
controlled by Cisco against any party for making, using, selling, importing
or offering for sale a product that implements the standard, provided,
however that Cisco retains the right to assert its patents (including the
right to claim past royalties) against any party that asserts a patent it
owns or controls (either directly or indirectly) against Cisco or any of
Cisco's affiliates or successors in title; and Cisco retains the right to
assert its patents against any product or portion thereof that is not
necessary for compliance with the standard.

Royalty-bearing licenses will be available to anyone who prefers that
option.
