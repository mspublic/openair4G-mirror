This sample login.radius was contributed by Miguel A.L. Paraz
<map@iphil.net>. It implements PPP, Telnet and Rlogin connections.

There currently is no documentation but the scripts are very clear and
should provide a good starting point.

The ip-up and ip-down scripts must be installed under /etc/ppp so that the
pppd can find them.
