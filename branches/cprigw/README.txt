The OpenAirInterface (OAI) software is composed of six different parts: 

openair1: 3GPP LTE Rel-8 PHY layer + PHY RF simulation

openair2: 3GPP LTE Rel-9 RLC/MAC/PDCP/RRC implementations, eNB application, X2AP. Note that for RLC, the following versions are userL UM_v9.3.0, TM_v9.3.0, and AM_v9.3.0. For PDCP, PDCP_v10.1.0 is used. For RRC, only LITE is used.

openair3: additional networking protocols (PMIP, MIH, Multicasting) and scripts 

openair-cn: 3GPP LTE Rel9 and 10 MME/NAS, S+P-GW, HSS, S1AP (ENB and MME).

openairITS: IEEE 802.11p software modem (all layers)

common: some common OAI utilities, other tools can be found at openair2/UTILS


targets: scripts to compile and lauch different system targets (simulation, emulation and real-time platforms, user-space tools for these platforms (tbd))
