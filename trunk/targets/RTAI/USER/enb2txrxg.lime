# this file contains the calibration values to compute the RSSI
# we can use three different gain stages (high, low, med) as well as a gain factor for fine tuning
# the three lines in this file gives the total rx gain in dB for the three gain stages if the rx gain is set to 30dB
# high gain
138 138 138 138
# med gain
129 129 129 129
# low gain
120 120 120 120
