# this file contains the calibration values to compute the RSSI
# we can use three different gain stages (high, low, med) as well as a gain factor for fine tuning
# the three lines in this file gives the total rx gain in dB for the three gain stages if the rx gain is set to 30dB
# this is for Express MIMO2 without any additional RF frontend
# high gain
103 107 106 104
# med gain
98 101 100 98
# low gain (byp)
94 97 96 94
