Title: Nokia Corporation's statement about IPR claimed in draft-ietf-nemo-basic-support
Received: July 1, 2003
From: Heikki Huttunen <heikki.a.huttunen@nokia.com>

This is to advise the IETF that Nokia believes the Nokia patent application "Mobile Router 
Support for IPv6", US10/295014, WO03/043226 may be relevant to Nemo Basic Support Protocol 
<draft-ietf-nemo-basic-support>.

Regarding internet draft "draft-ietf-nemo-basic-support", to the extent this draft is 
included into final IETF standard specification, Nokia agrees not to assert those claims 
in Nokia patents that apply to this draft and that are technically necessary to implement 
the IETF standard specification against any other party in respect of its implementation of 
the specification, if only practiced under any software distributed under the present terms 
of GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.html) or under license terms 
that conform to the present open source definition (http://www.opensource.org/osd.html) and 
provided that the party relying on this commitment does not assert its patents against Nokia.

Otherwise general Nokia Statement on Patent Licensing (http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/NOKIA) 
applies to this submission.
