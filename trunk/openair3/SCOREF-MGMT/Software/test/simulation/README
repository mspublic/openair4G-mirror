0. Introduction
   This directory involves the simulation of GN and FAC to test these interfaces.

1. Dependencies
   Python packages should be installed.

2. Building
   There is no build for this tool, it's plain Python which is interpreted rather 
   than to be built, see section 3. Running.

3. Commands
   Following commands are supported.

   DEFINE_SERVER_PORT <port>
   Defines the destination port (i.e. the MGMT-CORE's port)

   DEFINE_CLIENT_PORT <port>
   Defines the client's port (i.e. source port that is used to send the packets to MGMT-CORE from)

   DEFINE_TYPE
   Defines client type, can be 'GN' or 'FAC'

   SEND COMMUNICATION_PROFILE_REQUEST
   Sends a COMMUNICATION_PROFILE_REQUEST packet to MGMT-CORE's given port

   SEND NETWORK_STATE
   Sends a NETWORK_STATE packet to MGMT-CORE's given port

   SEND LOCATION_UPDATE
   Sends a LOCATION_UPDATE to MGMT-CORE's given port

   SEND CONFIGURATION_NOTIFICATION
   Sends a CONFIGURATION_NOTIFICATION to MGMT-CORE's given port

   SEND GET_CONFIGURATION
   Sends a GET_CONFIGURATION to MGMT-CORE's given port

4. Running
   Since this simulator has been written in Python one needs the Python interpreter.
   In order to run first scenario file, for example,
   
   $ python main.py scenarios/01.sce
