Archives in this directory contain static binaries, so any kind 
of run-time linkage error is not expected. Please let me know 
if you experience such an error.

LZMA archives can be extracted as follows,

tar xfa IF.MGMT-v1.0.4.tar.lzma

Not for all versions a binary is created when the change is 
subtle and/or documentation related. So follow Software/ directory
for most up-to-date version.
