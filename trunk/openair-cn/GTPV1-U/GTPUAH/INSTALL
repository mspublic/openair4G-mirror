How to build
------------

1. Extract the files in a location of your choice. The
   Files will be extracted in a directory called gtpu.

2. cd <gtpu_dir>/gtpu. 

3. make

If make is successful, the binary files (libxt_GTPU.so and xt_GTPU.ko) 
will be created in the Bin folder.


How to install
--------------
There is no "make install" as that will be difficult to support all
possible Linux distro. The cmd.sh file demonstrates how to install
the two binary files in the system.


In case of problem:
 - check you got the last release of the library (see README),
 - contact the mailing list (see README),
 - check the bugtracker for known bugs (see README).


Documentation
-------------
Please have a look at the "Architecture" section in the README.
