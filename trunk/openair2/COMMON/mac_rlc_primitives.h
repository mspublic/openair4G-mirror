/** @defgroup _mac_rlc_primitives_ MAC Layer Primitives for Communications with RLC
 * @ingroup _openair_mac_layer_specs_
 * @{
This subclause describes the primitives for communications between the RLC and MAC sub-layers.


This clause describes the primitives for communications between the RLC and MAC sub-layers.  It is largely inspired by
3GPP TS 25.321 V4.2.0.

MAC-STATUS-Ind (mac_status_ind} primitive indicates to RLC for each logical channel the rate at which it may transfer data to MAC. Parameters
are the number of PDUs that can be transferred in each transmission time interval and the PDU size; it is possible that MAC
would use this primitive to indicate that it expects the current buffer occupancy of the addressed logical channel in order
to provide for optimised TFC selection on transport channels with long transmission time interval. At the UE, MAC-STATUS-Ind
primitive is also used to indicate from MAC to RLC that MAC has requested data transmission by PHY (i.e. PHY-DATA-REQ has
been submitted, see Fig. 11.2.2.1), or that transmission of an RLC PDU on RACH or CPCH has failed due to exceeded preamble
ramping cycle counter.

MAC-STATUS-Resp (mac_status_resp) primitive enables RLC to acknowledge a MAC-STATUS-Ind. It is possible
that RLC would use this primitive to indicate that it has nothing to send or that it is
in a suspended state or to indicate the current buffer occupancy to MAC.

// Parameters:
// a)   data:
// -    it contains the RLC layer messages (RLC-PDU) to be transmitted, or the RLC layer messages
//    that have been received by the MAC sub-layer.
//
// b)   no_tb :
// -    indicates the number of transport blocks transmitted by the peer entity within the
//    transmission time interval, based on the TFI value.
//
// c)   buffer_occupancy :
// -    the parameter Buffer Occupancy (BO) indicates for each logical channel the amount of data
//    in number of bytes that is available for transmission and retransmission in RLC layer.
//    When MAC is connected to an AM RLC entity, control PDUs to be transmitted and RLC PDUs
//    outside the RLC Tx window shall also be included in the BO. RLC PDUs that have been
//    transmitted but not negatively acknowledged by the peer entity shall not be included in the BO.
//
// d)   rx_timing_deviation, TDD only:
// -    it contains the RX Timing Deviation as measured by the physical layer for the physical
//    resources carrying the data of the Message Unit. This parameter is optional and only for
//    Indication. It is needed for the transfer of the RX Timing Deviation measurement of RACH
//    transmissions carrying CCCH data to RRC.
//
// e)   no_pdu:
// -    specifies the number of PDUs that the RLC is permitted to transfer to MAC within a
//    transmission time interval.
//
// f)   pdu_size:
// -    specifies the size of PDU that can be transferred to MAC within a transmission time interval.
//
// g)   UE-ID Type Indicator:
// -    indicates the UE-ID type to be included in MAC for a DCCH when it is mapped onto a common
//    transport channel (i.e. FACH, RACH, DSCH in FDD or CPCH). On the UE side UE-ID Type Indicator
//    shall always be set to C-RNTI.
//
// h)   tx_status:
// -    when set to value "transmission unsuccessful" this parameter indicates to RLC that transmission
//    of an RLC PDU failed in the previous Transmission Time Interval, when set to value
//    "transmission successful" this parameter indicates to RLC that the requested RLC PDU(s)
//     has been submitted for transmission by the physical layer.
//
// i)   rlc_info
// -    indicates to MAC the configuration parameters that are critical to TFC selection depending
//    on its mode and the amount of data that could be transmitted at the next TTI. This primitive
//    is meant to insure that MAC can perform TFC selection.
