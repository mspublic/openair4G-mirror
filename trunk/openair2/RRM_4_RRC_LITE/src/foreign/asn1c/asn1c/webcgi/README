This is the source of the CGI-based Web wrapper around asn1c compiler.

To install, execute the following steps in this directory

	CGIDIR=/path/where/webserver/CGIs/are/stored
	make				# Ensure the binary files are built
	cp asn1c.cgi asn1c-suid-helper $CGIDIR
	chgrp www $CGIDIR/asn1c-suid-helper	# Or whatever Web server has
	chown root $CGIDIR/asn1c-suid-helper
	chmod 4550 $CGIDIR/asn1c-suid-helper	# Make it setuid
	# edit the $CGIDIR/asn1c.cgi to set up a few preferences
	# in the beginning of that Perl script.

The chmod command makes the asn1c-suid-helper program setuid.
The asn1c-suid-helper is a tiny wrapper (look in the asn1c-suid-helper.c),
which has the single purpose of running the asn1c compiler under extremely
strict environment.
The root uid and 4555 mode actually _raise_ security of the whole ASN.1 CGI
system, so don't worry.
If you're still uncertain, just go read the source code, it's only a page long.
