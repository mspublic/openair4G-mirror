The name of the check-N.c file is used as a pointer to the file
../../tests/N-*.asn1. This ASN.1 file is compiled using the asn1c compiler
from the above directory. After that, everything is coompiled together
in a temporary directory with a check-N.c used as a testing engine.

For manual execution of a specific test case, use the following pattern:

	./check-assembly.sh check-<NN>.c
