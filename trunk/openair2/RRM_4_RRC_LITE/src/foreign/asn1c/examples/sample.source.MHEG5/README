GENERAL INFORMATION
===================

The ISO MHEG-5 (Multimedia Hypermedia Experts Group,
Multimedia Presentations) decoder.

Invoking `make` will first attempt compile the ASN.1 specifications from the
../ISO13522-MHEG-5.asn file. THERE IS NO ISO13522-MHEG-5.asn FILE THERE YET!

OBTAINING THE MHEG-5 SPECIFICATION
==================================

Due to licensing restrictions, asn1c can not include the MHEG-5 ASN.1 module
in its distribution.

To obtain the MHEG-5 ASN.1 specification, you should go to
	http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/asn1/database/itu-t/t/t172
and select the latest "Text" version of the corresponding ASN.1 module.

After obtaining the ISO13522-MHEG-5.asn, type `make` in the directory
containing this README file.

mheg5dump USAGE
===============

The mheg5dump utility may be used to dump the contents of the BER-encoded
MHEG-5 data record file:

	./mheg5dump mhegscene.ber	# Print MHEG-5 stream as XML (BASIC-XER)

The full list of recognized command line options may be obtained with

	./mheg5dump -h
