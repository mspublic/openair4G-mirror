GENERAL INFORMATION
===================

The GSM TAP3 (Transferred Account Procedure, Version 3) decoder.
Invoking `make` will compile the ASN.1 specifications from the
../tap3.asn1 file.

THERE IS NO tap3.asn1 FILE THERE YET!

OBTAINING THE TAP3 SPECIFICATION
================================

Due to licensing restrictions, asn1c can not include the TAP3 ASN.1 module
in its distribution.

To obtain the TAP3 ASN.1 specification, you should go to
	http://www.gsmworld.com/using/billing/tap3_legal.html
and agree with their licensing terms by clicking the "I ACCEPT" button.

A .ZIP file with several Microsoft Word .DOC files will download shortly.

You should extract the TAP-0311 ASN.1 module from one of these .DOC files
and save it as the ../tap3.asn1 file. The ../tap3.asn1 file should start with
the following line
	"TAP-0311 DEFINITIONS IMPLICIT TAGS ::="
and end with the "END" token.
Be careful not to copy any non-ASN.1 preambles from that .DOC file.

After obtaining the tap3.asn1, type `make` in the directory containing
this README file.

tap3dump USAGE
==============

The tap3dump utility may be used to dump the contents of the BER-encoded
TAP3 data record file:

	./tap3dump tapfile.ber	# Print as XML (BASIC-XER)

The full list of recognized command line options may be obtained with

	> ./tap3dump -h
