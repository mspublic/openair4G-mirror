 * @{
This set of routines are used to generate quantized (i.e. fixed-point) Gaussian random noise efficiently. 
The use of these routines allows for rapid computer simulation of digital communication systems. The method 
is based on a lookup-table of the quantized normal probability distribution.  The routines assume that the 
continuous-valued Gaussian random-variable,\f$x\f$ is quantized
to \f$N\f$ bits over the interval \f$[-L\sigma,L\sigma)\f$ where \f$N\f$ and \f$L\f$ control the precision 
and range of the quantization.  The 
random variable, \f$l\in\{-2^{N-1},-2^{N-1}+1,\cdots,0,1,\cdots,2^{N-1}-1\}\f$ corresponds to the event, 
\f$E_l = 
\begin{cases} 
x\in\left[-\infty,-L\sigma\right) & l=-2^{N-1}, \\
