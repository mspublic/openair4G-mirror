4.1	Introduction
This specification is organised as follows:
-	sub-clause 4.2 describes the RRC protocol model;
-	sub-clause 4.3 specifies the services provided to upper layers as well as the services expected from lower layers;
-	sub-clause 4.4 lists the RRC functions;
-	clause 5 specifies RRC procedures, including UE state transitions;
-	clause 6 specifies the RRC message in a mixed format (i.e. tabular & ASN.1 together);
-	clause 7 specifies the variables (including protocol timers and constants) and counters to be used by the UE;
-	clause 8 specifies the encoding of the RRC messages;
-	clause 9 specifies the specified and default radio configurations;
-	clause 10 specifies the RRC messages transferred across network nodes;
-	clause 11 specifies the UE capability related constraints and performance requirements.
4.2	Architecture
4.2.1	UE states and state transitions including inter RAT
A UE is in RRC_CONNECTED when an RRC connection has been established. If this is not the case, i.e. no RRC connection is established, the UE is in RRC_IDLE state. The RRC states can further be characterised as follows:
-	RRC_IDLE:
-	A UE specific DRX may be configured by upper layers.
-	UE controlled mobility;
-	The UE:
-	Monitors a Paging channel to detect incoming calls, system information change, and for ETWS capable UEs, ETWS notification;
-	Performs neighbouring cell measurements and cell (re-)selection;
-	Acquires system information.
-	RRC_CONNECTED:
-	Transfer of unicast data to/from UE.
-	At lower layers, the UE may be configured with a UE specific DRX.
-	Network controlled mobility, i.e. handover and cell change order with optional network assistance (NACC) to GERAN;
-	The UE:
-	Monitors a Paging channel and/ or System Information Block Type 1 contents to detect system information change, and for ETWS capable UEs, ETWS notification;
Monitors control channels associated with the shared data channel to determine if data is scheduled for it;
-	Provides channel quality and feedback information;
-	Performs neighbouring cell measurements and measurement reporting;
-	Acquires system information.
The following figure not only provides an overview of the RRC states in E-UTRA, but also illustrates the mobility support between E-UTRAN, UTRAN and GERAN.

Figure 4.2.1-1: E-UTRA states and inter RAT mobility procedures, 3GPP
The following figure illustrates the mobility support between E-UTRAN, CDMA2000 1xRTT and CDMA2000 HRPD. The details of the CDMA2000 state models are out of the scope of this specification.

Figure 4.2.1-2: Mobility procedures between E-UTRA and CDMA2000
The inter-RAT handover procedure(s) supports the case of signalling, conversational services, non-conversational services and combinations of these. The mobility between E-UTRA and non-3GPP systems other than CDMA2000 is FFS.
In addition to the state transitions shown in Figure 4.2.1-1 and Figure 4.2.1-2, there is support for connection release with redirection information from E-UTRA RRC_CONNECTED to GERAN, UTRAN and CDMA2000 (HRPD Idle/ 1xRTT Dormant mode).
4.2.2	Signalling radio bearers
"Signalling Radio Bearers" (SRBs) are defined as Radio Bearers (RB) that are used only for the transmission of RRC and NAS messages. More specifically, the following three SRBs are defined:
-	SRB0 is for RRC messages using the CCCH logical channel;
-	SRB1 is for RRC messages (which may include a piggybacked NAS message) as well as for NAS messages prior to the establishment of SRB2, all using DCCH logical channel;
-	SRB2 is for NAS messages, using DCCH logical channel. SRB2 has a lower-priority than SRB1 and is always configured by E-UTRAN after security activation.
In downlink piggybacking of NAS messages is used only for one dependant (i.e. with joint success/ failure) procedure: bearer establishment/ modification/ release. In uplink NAS message piggybacking is used only for transferring the initial NAS message during connection setup.
NOTE:		The NAS messages transferred via SRB2 are also contained in RRC messages, which however do not include any RRC protocol control information.
Once security is activated, all RRC messages on SRB1 and SRB2, including those containing NAS or non-3GPP messages, are integrity protected and ciphered by PDCP. NAS independently applies integrity protection and ciphering to the NAS messages.
4.3	Services
4.3.1	Services provided to upper layers
The RRC protocol offers the following services to upper layers:
-	Broadcast of common control information;
-	Notification of UEs in RRC_IDLE, e.g. about a terminating call, for ETWS;
-	Transfer of dedicated control information, i.e. information for one specific UE.
4.3.2	Services expected from lower layers
In brief, the following are the main services that RRC expects from lower layers:
-	PDCP: integrity protection and ciphering;
-	RLC: reliable and in-sequence transfer of information, without introducing duplicates and with support for segmentation and concatenation.
Further details about the services provided by Packet Data Convergence Protocol layer (e.g. integrity and ciphering) are provided in TS 36.323 [8]. The services provided by Radio Link Control layer (e.g. the RLC modes) are specified in TS 36.322 [7]. Further details about the services provided by Medium Access Control layer (e.g. the logical channels) are provided in TS 36.321 [6]. The services provided by physical layer (e.g. the transport channels) are specified in TS 36.302 [3].
4.4	Functions
The RRC protocol includes the following main functions:
-	Broadcast of system information:
-	Including NAS common information;
-	Information applicable for UEs in RRC_IDLE, e.g. cell (re-)selection parameters, neighbouring cell information and information (also) applicable for UEs in RRC_CONNECTED, e.g. common channel configuration information.
-	Including ETWS notification;
-	RRC connection control:
-	Paging;
-	Establishment/ modification/ release of RRC connection, including e.g. assignment/ modification of UE identity (C-RNTI), establishment/ modification/ release of SRB1 and SRB2, access class barring;
-	Initial security activation, i.e. initial configuration of AS integrity protection (SRBs) and AS ciphering (SRBs, DRBs);
-	RRC connection mobility including e.g. intra-frequency and inter-frequency handover, associated security handling, i.e. key/ algorithm change, specification of RRC context information transferred between network nodes;
-	Establishment/ modification/ release of RBs carrying user data (DRBs);
-	Radio configuration control including e.g. assignment/ modification of ARQ configuration, HARQ configuration, DRX configuration;
-	QoS control including assignment/ modification of semi-persistent scheduling (SPS) configuration information for DL and UL, assignment/ modification of parameters for UL rate control in the UE, i.e. allocation of a priority and a prioritised bit rate (PBR) for each RB;
-	Recovery from radio link failure;
-	Inter-RAT mobility including e.g. security activation, transfer of RRC context information;
-	Measurement configuration and reporting:
-	Establishment/ modification/ release of measurements (e.g. intra-frequency, inter-frequency and inter- RAT measurements);
-	Setup and release of measurement gaps;
-	Measurement reporting;
-	Other functions including e.g. transfer of dedicated NAS information and non-3GPP dedicated information, transfer of UE radio access capability information, support for E-UTRAN sharing (multiple PLMN identities);
-	Generic protocol error handling;
-	Support of self-configuration and self-optimisation;
NOTE:		Random access is specified entirely in the MAC’ including initial transmission power estimation.
5	Procedures
5.1	General
5.1.1	Introduction
The procedural requirements are structured according to the main functional areas: system information (5.2), connection control (5.3), inter-RAT mobility (5.4) and measurements (5.5). In addition there is a sub-clause other (5.6) that covers e.g. NAS dedicated information transfer, UE capability transfer. Finally, sub-clause 5.7 specifies the generic error handling.
5.1.2	General requirements
The UE shall:
1>	process the received messages in order of reception by RRC, i.e. the processing of a message shall be completed before starting the processing of a subsequent message;
NOTE 1:	E-UTRAN may initiate a subsequent procedure prior to receiving the UE's response of a previously initiated procedure.
1>	within a sub-clause execute the steps according to the order specified in the procedural description;
1>	set the rrc-TransactionIdentifier in the response message, if included, to the same value as included in the message received from E-UTRAN that triggered the response message;
1>	upon receiving a choice value set to ‘setup’:
2>	apply the corresponding received configuration and start using the associated resources, unless explicitly specified otherwise;
1>	upon receiving a choice value set to ‘release’:
2>	clear the corresponding configuration and stop using the associated resources;
NOTE 2:	At each point in time, the UE keeps a single value for each field except for during handover when the UE temporarily stores the previous configuration so it can revert back upon handover failure. In other words: when the UE reconfigures a field, the existing value is released except for during handover.
5.2	System information
5.2.1	Introduction
5.2.1.1	General
System information is divided into the MasterInformationBlock (MIB) and a number of SystemInformationBlocks (SIBs). The MIB includes a limited number of most essential and most frequently transmitted parameters that are needed to acquire other information from the cell, and is transmitted on BCH. SIBs other than SystemInformationBlockType1 are carried in SystemInformation (SI) messages and mapping of SIBs to SI messages is flexibly configurable by schedulingInfoList included in SystemInformationBlockType1, with restrictions that: each SIB is contained only in a single SI message, only SIBs having the same scheduling requirement (periodicity) can be mapped to the same SI message, and SystemInformationBlockType2 is always mapped to the SI message that corresponds to the first entry in the list of SI messages in schedulingInfoList. There may be multiple SI messages transmitted with the same periodicity. SystemInformationBlockType1 and all SI messages are transmitted on DL-SCH.
5.2.1.2	Scheduling
The MIB uses a fixed schedule with a periodicity of 40 ms and repetitions made within 40 ms. The first transmission of the MIB is scheduled in subframe #0 of radio frames for which the SFN mod 4 = 0, and repetitions are scheduled in subframe #0 of all other radio frames.
The SystemInformationBlockType1 uses a fixed schedule with a periodicity of 80 ms and repetitions made within 80 ms. The first transmission of SystemInformationBlockType1 is scheduled in subframe #5 of radio frames for which the SFN mod 8 = 0, and repetitions are scheduled in subframe #5 of all other radio frames for which SFN mod 2 = 0.
The SI messages are transmitted within periodically occurring time domain windows (referred to as SI-windows) using dynamic scheduling. Each SI message is associated with a SI-window and the SI-windows of different SI messages do not overlap. That is, within one SI-window only the corresponding SI is transmitted. The length of the SI-window is common for all SI messages, and is configurable. Within the SI-window, the corresponding SI message can be transmitted a number of times in any subframe other than MBSFN subframes, uplink subframes in TDD, and subframe #5 of radio frames for which SFN mod 2 = 0. The UE acquires the detailed time-domain scheduling (and other information, e.g. frequency-domain scheduling, used transport format) from decoding SI-RNTI on PDCCH (see TS 36.321 [6]).
A single SI-RNTI is used to address SystemInformationBlockType1 as well as all SI messages.
SystemInformationBlockType1 configures the SI-window length and the transmission periodicity for the SI messages.
5.2.1.3	System information validity and notification of changes
Change of system information (other than for ETWS) only occurs at specific radio frames, i.e. the concept of a modification period is used. System information may be transmitted a number of times with the same content within a modification period, as defined by its scheduling. The modification period boundaries are defined by SFN values for which SFN mod m= 0, where m is the number of radio frames comprising the modification period. The modification period is configured by system information.
When the network changes (some of the) system information, it first notifies the UEs about this change, i.e. this may be done throughout a modification period. In the next modification period, the network transmits the updated system information. These general principles are illustrated in figure 5.2.1.3-1, in which different colours indicate different system information. Upon receiving a change notification, the UE acquires the new system information immediately from the start of the next modification period. The UE applies the previously acquired system information until the UE acquires the new system information.

Figure 5.2.1.3-1: Change of system Information
The Paging message is used to inform UEs in RRC_IDLE and UEs in RRC_CONNECTED about a system information change. If the UE receives a Paging message including the systemInfoModification, it knows that the system information will change at the next modification period boundary. Although the UE may be informed about changes in system information, no further details are provided e.g. regarding which system information will change.
SystemInformationBlockType1 includes a value tag, systemInfoValueTag, that indicates if a change has occurred in the SI messages. UEs may use systemInfoValueTag, e.g. upon return from out of coverage, to verify if the previously stored SI messages are still valid. Additionally, the UE considers stored system information to be invalid after 3 hours from the moment it was successfully confirmed as valid, unless specified otherwise.
E-UTRAN may not update systemInfoValueTag upon change of some system information e.g. ETWS information, regularly changing parameters like CDMA2000 system time (see 6.3). Similarly, E-UTRAN may not include the systemInfoModification within the Paging message upon change of some system information.
The UE verifies that stored system information remains valid by either checking systemInfoValueTag in SystemInformationBlockType1 after the modification period boundary, or attempting to find the systemInfoModification indication at least modificationPeriodCoeff times during the modification period in case no paging is received, in every modification period. If no paging message is received by the UE during a modification period, the UE may assume that no change of system information will occur at the next modification period boundary. If UE in RRC_CONNECTED, during a modification period, receives one paging message, it may deduce from the presence/ absence of systemInfoModification whether a change of system information other than ETWS information will occur in the next modification period or not.
ETWS capable UEs in RRC_CONNECTED shall attempt to read paging at least once every defaultPagingCycle to check whether ETWS notification is present or not.
5.2.1.4	Indication of ETWS notification
ETWS primary notification and/ or ETWS secondary notification can occur at any point in time. The Paging message is used to inform ETWS capable UEs in RRC_IDLE and UEs in RRC_CONNECTED about presence of an ETWS primary notification and/ or ETWS secondary notification. If the UE receives a Paging message including the etws-Indication, it shall start receiving the ETWS primary notification and/ or ETWS secondary notification according to schedulingInfoList contained in SystemInformationBlockType1.
ETWS primary notification is contained in SystemInformationBlockType10 and ETWS secondary notification is contained in SystemInformationBlockType11. Segmentation can be applied for the delivery of a secondary notification. The segmentation is fixed for transmission of a given secondary notification within a cell (i.e. the same segment size for a given segment with the same messageIdentifier, serialNumber and warningMessageSegmentNumber).
5.2.2	System information acquisition
5.2.2.1	General

Figure 5.2.2.1-1: System information acquisition, normal
The UE applies the system information acquisition procedure to acquire the AS- and NAS- system information that is broadcasted by the E-UTRAN. The procedure applies to UEs in RRC_IDLE and UEs in RRC_CONNECTED.
5.2.2.2	Initiation
The UE shall apply the system information acquisition procedure upon selecting (e.g. upon power on) and upon re-selecting a cell, after handover completion, after entering E-UTRA from another RAT, upon return from out of coverage, upon receiving a notification that the system information has changed, upon receiving an indication about the presence of an ETWS notification, upon receiving a request from CDMA2000 upper layers and upon exceeding the maximum validity duration. Unless explicitly stated otherwise in the procedural specification, the system information acquisition procedure overwrites any stored system information, i.e. delta configuration is not applicable for system information and the UE discontinues using a field if it is absent in system information unless explicitly specified otherwise.
5.2.2.3	System information required by the UE
The UE shall:
1>	ensure having a valid version, as defined below, of (at least) the following system information, also referred to as the ‘required’ system information:
2>	if in RRC_IDLE:
3>	the MasterInformationBlock and SystemInformationBlockType1 as well as SystemInformationBlockType2 through SystemInformationBlockType8, depending on support of the concerned RATs;
2>	if in RRC_CONNECTED:
3>	the MasterInformationBlock, SystemInformationBlockType1 and SystemInformationBlockType2 as well as SystemInformationBlockType8, depending on support of CDMA2000;
1>	delete any stored system information after 3 hours from the moment it was confirmed to be valid as defined in 5.2.1.3, unless specified otherwise;
1>	consider any stored system information except SystemInformationBlockType10 and SystemInformationBlockType11 to be invalid if systemInfoValueTag included in the SystemInformationBlockType1 is different from the one of the stored system information;
5.2.2.4	System information acquisition by the UE
The UE shall:
1>	apply the specified BCCH configuration defined in 9.1.1.1;
1>	if the procedure is triggered by a system information change notification:
2>	start acquiring the required system information, as defined in 5.2.2.3, from the beginning of the modification period following the one in which the change notification was received;
NOTE 1:	The UE continues using the previously received system information until the new system information has been acquired.
1>	if the UE is in RRC_IDLE and enters a cell for which the UE does not have stored a valid version of the system information required in RRC_IDLE, as defined in 5.2.2.3:
2>	acquire, using the system information acquisition procedure as defined in 5.2.3, the system information required in RRC_IDLE, as defined in 5.2.2.3;
1>	following successful handover completion to a cell for which the UE does not have stored a valid version of the system information required in RRC_CONNECTED, as defined in 5.2.2.3:
2>	acquire, using the system information acquisition procedure as defined in 5.2.3, the system information required in RRC_CONNECTED, as defined in 5.2.2.3;
2> upon acquiring the concerned system information:
3>	discard the corresponding radio resource configuration information included in the radioResourceConfigCommon previously received in a dedicated message, if any;
1>	following a request from CDMA2000 upper layers:
2>	acquire SystemInformationBlockType8, as defined in 5.2.3;
1>	neither initiate the RRC connection establishment procedure nor initiate transmission of the RRCConnectionReestablishmentRequest message until the UE has a valid version of the MasterInformationBlock and SystemInformationBlockType1 messages as well as SystemInformationBlockType2 ;
1>	if the UE is ETWS capable:
2>	upon entering a cell during RRC_IDLE, following successful handover or upon connection re-establishment:
3>		discard any previously buffered warningMessageSegment;

5.3	Connection control
5.3.1	Introduction
5.3.1.1	RRC connection control
RRC connection establishment involves the establishment of SRB1. E-UTRAN completes RRC connection establishment prior to completing the establishment of the S1 connection, i.e. prior to receiving the UE context information from the EPC. Consequently, AS security is not activated during the initial phase of the RRC connection. During this initial phase of the RRC connection, the E-UTRAN may configure the UE to perform measurement reporting. However, the UE only accepts a handover message when security has been activated.
Upon receiving the UE context from the EPC, E-UTRAN activates security (both ciphering and integrity protection) using the initial security activation procedure. The RRC messages to activate security (command and successful response) are integrity protected, while ciphering is started only after completion of the procedure. That is, the response to the message used to activate security is not ciphered, while the subsequent messages (e.g. used to establish SRB2 and DRBs) are both integrity protected and ciphered.
After having initiated the initial security activation procedure, E-UTRAN initiates the establishment of SRB2 and DRBs, i.e. E-UTRAN may do this prior to receiving the confirmation of the initial security activation from the UE. In any case, E-UTRAN will apply both ciphering and integrity protection for the RRC connection reconfiguration messages used to establish SRB2 and DRBs. E-UTRAN should release the RRC connection if the initial security activation and/ or the radio bearer establishment fails (i.e. security activation and DRB establishment are triggered by a joint S1-procedure, which does not support partial success).
For SRB2 and DRBs, security is always activated from the start, i.e. the E-UTRAN does not establish these bearers prior to activating security.
The release of the RRC connection is initiated by E-UTRAN. The procedure may be used to re-direct the UE to another frequency or RAT. In exceptional cases the UE may abort the RRC connection, i.e. move to RRC_IDLE without notifying E-UTRAN.
5.3.1.2	Security
AS security comprises of the integrity protection of RRC signalling (SRBs) as well as the ciphering of RRC signalling (SRBs) and user data (DRBs).
RRC handles the configuration of the security parameters which are part of the AS configuration: the integrity protection algorithm, the ciphering algorithm and two parameters, namely the keyChangeIndicator and the nextHopChainingCount, which are used by the UE to determine the AS security keys upon handover and/ or connection re-establishment.
The integrity protection algorithm is common for signalling radio bearers SRB1 and SRB2. The ciphering algorithm is common for all radio bearers (i.e. SRB1, SRB2 and DRBs). Neither integrity protection nor ciphering applies for SRB0.
RRC integrity and ciphering are always activated together, i.e. in one message/ procedure. RRC integrity and ciphering are never de-activated. However, it is possible to switch to a ‘NULL’ ciphering algorithm (eea0).
NOTE 1:	UICC-less emergency calls are not supported in this release of the specification.
NOTE 2:	Lower layers discard RRC messages for which the integrity check has failed and indicate the integrity verification check failure to RRC.
The AS applies three different security keys: one for the integrity protection of RRC signalling (KRRCint), one for the ciphering of RRC signalling (KRRCenc) and one for the ciphering of user data (KUPenc). All three AS keys are derived from the KeNB key. The KeNB is based on the KASME key, which is handled by upper layers.
Upon connection establishment new AS keys are derived. No AS-parameters are exchanged to serve as inputs for the derivation of the new AS keys at connection establishment.
The integrity and ciphering of the RRC message used to perform handover is based on the security configuration used prior to the handover and is performed by the source eNB.
The integrity and ciphering algorithms can only be changed upon handover. The four AS keys (KeNB, KRRCint, KRRCenc and KUPenc) change upon every handover and connection re-establishment. The keyChangeIndicator is used upon handover and indicates whether the UE should use the keys associated with the latest available KASME key. The nextHopChainingCount parameter is used upon handover and connection re-establishment by the UE when deriving the new KeNB that is used to generate KRRCint, KRRCenc and KUPenc (see TS 33.401 [32]). An intra cell handover procedure may be used to change the keys in RRC_CONNECTED.
For each radio bearer an independent counter (COUNT, as specified in TS 36.323 [8]) is maintained for each direction. For each DRB, the COUNT is used as input for ciphering. For each SRB, the COUNT is used as input for both ciphering and integrity protection. It is not allowed to use the same COUNT value more than once for a given security key. In order to limit the signalling overhead, individual messages/ packets include a short sequence number (PDCP SN, as specified in TS 36.323 [8]). In addition, an overflow counter mechanism is used: the hyper frame number (TX_HFN and RX_HFN, as specified in TS 36.323 [8]). The HFN needs to be synchronized between the UE and the eNB. The eNB is responsible for avoiding reuse of the COUNT with the same RB identity and with the same KeNB, e.g. due to the transfer of large volumes of data, release and establishment of new RBs. In order to avoid such re-use, the eNB may e.g. use different RB identities for successive RB establishments, trigger an intra cell handover or an RRC_CONNECTED to RRC_IDLE to RRC_CONNECTED transition.
For each SRB, the value provided by RRC to lower layers to derive the 5-bit BEARER parameter used as input for ciphering and for integrity protection is the value of the corresponding srb-Identity with the MSBs padded with zeroes.
5.3.1.3	Connected mode mobility
In RRC_CONNECTED, the network controls UE mobility, i.e. the network decides when the UE shall move to which cell (which may be on another frequency or RAT). For network controlled mobility in RRC_CONNECTED, handover is the only procedure that is defined. The network triggers the handover procedure e.g. based on radio conditions, load. To facilitate this, the network may configure the UE to perform measurement reporting (possibly including the configuration of measurement gaps). The network may also initiate handover blindly, i.e. without having received measurement reports from the UE.
Before sending the handover message to the UE, the source eNB prepares one or more target cells. The target eNB generates the message used to perform the handover, i.e. the message including the AS-configuration to be used in the target cell. The source eNB transparently (i.e. does not alter values/ content) forwards the handover message/ information received from the target to the UE. When appropriate, the source eNB may initiate data forwarding for (a subset of) the DRBs.
After receiving the handover message, the UE attempts to access the target cell at the first available RACH occasion according to Random Access resource selection defined in TS 36.321 [6], i.e. the handover is asynchronous. Consequently, when allocating a dedicated preamble for the random access in the target cell, E-UTRA shall ensure it is available from the first RACH occasion the UE may use. Upon successful completion of the handover, the UE sends a message used to confirm the handover.
After the successful completion of handover, PDCP SDUs may be re-transmitted in the target cell. This only applies for DRBs using RLC-AM mode. The further details are specified in TS 36.323 [8]. After the successful completion of handover, the SN and the HFN are reset except for the DRBs using RLC-AM mode (for which both SN and HFN continue). The further details are specified in TS 36.323 [8].
One UE behaviour to be performed upon handover is specified, i.e. this is regardless of the handover procedures used within the network (e.g. whether the handover includes X2 or S1 signalling procedures).
The source eNB should, for some time, maintain a context to enable the UE to return in case of handover failure. After having detected handover failure, the UE attempts to resume the RRC connection either in the source or in another cell using the RRC re-establishment procedure. This connection resumption succeeds only if the accessed cell is prepared, i.e. concerns a cell of the source eNB or of another eNB towards which handover preparation has been performed.
5.3.2	Paging
5.3.2.1	General

Figure 5.3.2.1-1: Paging
The purpose of this procedure is to transmit paging information to a UE in RRC_IDLE and/ or to inform UEs in RRC_IDLE and UEs in RRC_CONNECTED about a system information change and/ or about an ETWS primary notification and/ or ETWS secondary notification. The paging information is provided to upper layers, which in response may initiate RRC connection establishment, e.g. to receive an incoming call.
5.3.2.2	Initiation
E-UTRAN initiates the paging procedure by transmitting the Paging message at the UE’s paging occasion as specified in TS 36.304 [4]. E-UTRAN may address multiple UEs within a Paging message by including one PagingRecord for each UE. E-UTRAN may also indicate a change of system information and/ or provide an ETWS notification in the Paging message.
5.3.2.3	Reception of the Paging message by the UE
Upon receiving the Paging message, the UE shall:
1>	if in RRC_IDLE, for each of the PagingRecord, if any, included in the Paging message:
2>	if the ue-Identity included in the PagingRecord matches one of the UE identities allocated by upper layers:
3>	forward the ue-Identity and the cn-Domain to the upper layers;
1>	if the systemInfoModification is included:
2> re-acquire the required system information using the system information acquisition procedure as specified in 5.2.2.
1>	if the etws-Indication is included and the UE is ETWS capable:
2>	re-acquire SystemInformationBlockType1 immediately, i.e., without waiting until the next system information modification period boundary;
2>	if the schedulingInfoList indicates that SystemInformationBlockType10 is present:
3>	acquire SystemInformationBlockType10;

5.3.6	Counter check
5.3.6.1	General

Figure 5.3.6.1-1: Counter check procedure
The counter check procedure is used by E-UTRAN to request the UE to verify the amount of data sent/ received on each DRB. More specifically, the UE is requested to check if, for each DRB, the most significant bits of the COUNT match with the values indicated by E-UTRAN.
NOTE:	The procedure enables E-UTRAN to detect packet insertion by an intruder (a ‘man in the middle’).
5.3.6.2	Initiation
E-UTRAN initiates the procedure by sending a CounterCheck message.
NOTE:	E-UTRAN may initiate the procedure when any of the COUNT values reaches a specific value.
5.3.6.3	Reception of the CounterCheck message by the UE
Upon receiving the CounterCheck message, the UE shall:
1>	for each DRB that is established:

5.3.7	RRC connection re-establishment
5.3.7.1	General
	
Figure 5.3.7.1-1: RRC connection re-establishment, successful
	
Figure 5.3.7.1-2: RRC connection re-establishment, failure
The purpose of this procedure is to re-establish the RRC connection, which involves the resumption of SRB1 operation and the re-activation of security.
A UE in RRC_CONNECTED, for which security has been activated, may initiate the procedure in order to continue the RRC connection. The connection re-establishment succeeds only if the concerned cell is prepared i.e. has a valid UE context. In case E-UTRAN accepts the re-establishment, SRB1 operation resumes while the operation of other radio bearers remains suspended. If AS security has not been activated, the UE does not initiate the procedure but instead moves to RRC_IDLE directly.
E-UTRAN applies the procedure as follows:
-	to reconfigure SRB1 and to resume data transfer only for this RB;
-	to re-activate AS security without changing algorithms.
5.3.7.2	Initiation
The UE shall only initiate the procedure when AS security has been activated. The UE initiates the procedure when one of the following conditions is met:
1>	upon detecting radio link failure, in accordance with 5.3.11; or
1>	upon handover failure, in accordance with 5.3.5.6; or
1>	upon mobility from E-UTRA failure, in accordance with 5.4.3.5; or
1>	upon integrity check failure indication from lower layers; or
1>	upon an RRC connection reconfiguration failure, in accordance with 5.3.5.5;

1>	stop timer T310, if running;
1>	start timer T311;
1> suspend all RBs except SRB0;
1>	reset MAC;
1>	apply the default physical channel configuration as specified in 9.2.4;
1>	apply the default semi-persistent scheduling configuration as specified in 9.2.3;
1>	apply the default MAC main configuration as specified in 9.2.2;

2>	set the physCellId to the physical cell identity of the source cell (handover and mobility from E-UTRA failure) or of the cell in which the trigger for the re-establishment occurred (other cases);
2>	set the shortMAC-I to the 16 least significant bits of the MAC-I calculated:
3>	over the ASN.1 encoded as per section 8 (i.e., a multiple of 8 bits) VarShortMAC-Input;
3>	with the KRRCint key and integrity protection algorithm that was used in the source cell (handover and mobility from E-UTRA failure) or of the cell in which the trigger for the re-establishment occurred (other cases); and
3>	with all input bits for COUNT, BEARER and DIRECTION set to binary ones;
1>	set the reestablishmentCause as follows:
2>	if the re-establishment procedure was initiated due to reconfiguration failure as specified in 5.3.5.5 (the UE is unable to comply with the reconfiguration):
3>	set the reestablishmentCause to the value ‘reconfigurationFailure’;
2>	else if the re-establishment procedure was initiated due to handover failure as specified in 5.3.5.6 (intra-LTE handover failure) or 5.4.3.5 (inter-RAT mobility from EUTRA failure):
3>	set the reestablishmentCause to the value ‘handoverFailure’;

5.4	Inter-RAT mobility
5.4.1	Introduction
The general principles of connected mode mobility are described in 5.3.1.3. The general principles of the security handling upon connected mode mobility are described in 5.3.1.2.
For the (network controlled) inter RAT mobility from E-UTRA for a UE in RRC_CONNECTED, a single procedure is defined that supports both handover and cell change order with optional network assistance (NACC). In case of mobility to CDMA2000, the eNB decides when to move to the other RAT while the target RAT determines to which cell the UE shall move.
5.4.2	Handover to E-UTRA
5.4.2.1	General

Figure 5.4.2.1-1: Handover to E-UTRA, successful
The purpose of this procedure is to, under the control of the network, transfer a connection between the UE and another Radio Access Network (e.g. GERAN or UTRAN) to E-UTRAN.
The handover to E-UTRA procedure applies when SRBs, possibly in combination with DRBs, are established in another RAT. Handover from UTRAN to E-UTRAN applies only after integrity has been activated in UTRAN.
5.4.2.2	Initiation
The RAN using another RAT initiates the Handover to E-UTRA procedure, in accordance with the specifications applicable for the other RAT, by sending the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message via the radio access technology from which the inter-RAT handover is performed.
E-UTRAN applies the procedure as follows:
-	to activate ciphering, possibly using NULL algorithm, if not yet activated in the other RAT;
-	to establish SRB1, SRB2 and one or more DRBs, i.e. at least the DRB associated with the default EPS bearer is established;
5.4.2.3	Reception of the RRCConnectionReconfiguration by the UE
If the UE is able to comply with the configuration included in the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message, the UE shall:
1>	apply the default physical channel configuration as specified in 9.2.4;
1>	apply the default semi-persistent scheduling configuration as specified in 9.2.3;
1>	apply the default MAC main configuration as specified in 9.2.2;
1>	start timer T304 with the timer value set to t304, as included in the mobilityControlInfo;
1>	consider the target cell to be one on the frequency indicated by the carrierFreq with a physical cell identity indicated by the targetPhysCellId;
1>	start synchronising to the DL of the target cell;
1>	set the C-RNTI to the value of the newUE-Identity;
1>	for the target cell, apply the downlink bandwidth indicated by the dl-Bandwidth;
1>	for the target cell, apply the uplink bandwidth indicated by (the absence or presence of) the ul-Bandwidth;
1>	perform the radio resource configuration procedure as specified in 5.3.10;
1>	forward the nas-SecurityParamToEUTRA to the upper layers;
1>	derive the KeNB key, as specified in TS 33.401 [32];
1>	store the nextHopChainingCount value;
1>	derive the KRRCint key associated with the integrityProtAlgorithm, as specified in TS 33.401 [32];
1>	derive the KRRCenc key and the KUPenc key associated with the cipheringAlgorithm, as specified in TS 33.401 [32];
1>	configure lower layers to apply the indicated integrity protection algorithm and the KRRCint key immediately, i.e. the indicated integrity protection configuration shall be applied to all subsequent messages received and sent by the UE, including the message used to indicate the successful completion of the procedure;
1>	configure lower layers to apply the indicated ciphering algorithm, the KRRCenc key and the KUPenc key immediately, i.e. the indicated ciphering configuration shall be applied to all subsequent messages received and sent by the UE, including the message used to indicate the successful completion of the procedure;
1>	if the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message includes the measConfig:
2>	perform the measurement configuration procedure as specified in 5.5.2;
1>	submit the RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message to lower layers for transmission using the new configuration;
1>	use the default values specified in 9.2.5 for timer T310, T311 and constant N310, N311;
1>	if MAC successfully completes the random access procedure:
2>	stop timer T304;
2>	apply the parts of the configuration that do not require the UE to know the SFN of the target cell;
2>	apply the parts of the measurement and the radio resource configuration that require the UE to know the SFN of the target cell (e.g. measurement gaps, periodic CQI reporting, scheduling request configuration, sounding RS configuration), if any, upon acquiring the SFN of the target cell;
2>	enter E-UTRA RRC_CONNECTED, upon which the procedure ends;
Editor's note:	The handling of outstanding signalling/ data may need to be clarified.
5.4.2.4	Reconfiguration failure
The UE shall:
1>	if the UE is unable to comply with (part of) the configuration included in the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message:
2>	perform the actions defined for this failure case as defined in the specifications applicable for the other RAT;
NOTE 1:	The UE may apply above failure handling also in case the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message causes a protocol error for which the generic error handling as defined in 5.7 specifies that the UE shall ignore the message. 
NOTE 2:	If the UE is unable to comply with part of the configuration, it does not apply any part of the configuration, i.e. there is no partial success/ failure.
5.4.2.5	T304 expiry (handover to E-UTRA failure)
The UE shall:
1>	upon T304 expiry (handover to E-UTRA failure):
2>	reset MAC;
2>	perform the actions defined for this failure case as defined in the specifications applicable for the other RAT;
5.4.3	Mobility from E-UTRA
5.4.3.1	General

Figure 5.4.3.1-1: Mobility from E-UTRA, successful

Figure 5.4.3.1-2: Mobility from E-UTRA, failure
The purpose of this procedure is to move a UE in RRC_CONNECTED to a cell using another Radio Access Technology (RAT), e.g. GERAN, UTRA or CDMA2000 systems. The mobility from E-UTRA procedure covers both:
-	handover, i.e. the MobilityFromEUTRACommand message includes radio resources that have been allocated for the UE in the target cell; and
-	cell change order, i.e. the MobilityFromEUTRACommand message may include information facilitating access of and/ or connection establishment in the target cell, e.g. system information. Cell change order is applicable only to GERAN.
5.4.3.2	Initiation
E-UTRAN initiates the mobility from E-UTRA procedure to a UE in RRC_CONNECTED, possibly in response to a MeasurementReport message, by sending a MobilityFromEUTRACommand message. E-UTRAN applies the procedure as follows:
-	the procedure is initiated only when AS-security has been activated, and SRB2 with at least one DRB are setup and not suspended;
5.4.3.3	Reception of the MobilityFromEUTRACommand by the UE
The UE shall be able to receive a MobilityFromEUTRACommand message and perform a cell change order to GERAN, even if no prior UE measurements have been performed on the target cell.
The UE shall:
1>	stop timer T310, if running;
1>	if the MobilityFromEUTRACommand message includes the purpose set to ‘handover’:
2>	if the targetRAT-Type is set to ‘utra’ or ‘geran’:
3>	consider inter-RAT mobility as initiated towards the RAT indicated by the targetRAT-Type included in the MobilityFromEUTRACommand message;
3>	forward the nas-SecurityParamFromEUTRA to the upper layers;
3>	access the target cell indicated in the inter-RAT message in accordance with the specifications of the target RAT;
3>	if the targetRAT-Type is set to ‘geran’:
4>	use the contents of systemInformation, if provided for PS Handover, as the system information to begin access on the target GERAN cell;
NOTE 1:	If there are DRBs for which no radio bearers are established in the target RAT as indicated in the targetRAT-MessageContainer in the message, the E-UTRA RRC part of the UE does not indicate the release of the concerned DRBs to the upper layers. Upper layers may derive which bearers are not established from information received from the AS of the target RAT.
2>	else if the targetRAT-Type is set to ‘cdma2000-1XRTT’ or ‘cdma2000-HRPD’:
3>	forward the targetRAT-Type and the targetRAT-MessageContainer to the CDMA2000 upper layers for the UE to access the cell indicated in the inter-RAT message in accordance with the specifications of the CDMA2000 target-RAT;
1>	else if the MobilityFromEUTRACommand message includes the purpose set to ‘cellChangeOrder’:
2>	start timer T304 with the timer value set to t304, as included in the MobilityFromEUTRACommand message;
2>	if the targetRAT-Type is set to ‘geran’:
3>	if networkControlOrder is included in the MobilityFromEUTRACommand message:
4>	apply the value as specified in TS 44.060 [36];
3>	else:
4>	acquire networkControlOrder and apply the value as specified in TS 44.060 [36];
3>	use the contents of systemInformation, if provided, as the system information to begin access on the target GERAN cell;
NOTE 2:	The systemInformation is constructed in the same way as in 2G to 2G NACC, i.e. the PSI messages are encoded as such, whereas the SI messages exclude 2 octets of headers, see TS 44.060[36].
2>	establish the connection to the target cell indicated in the CellChangeOrder;
NOTE 3:	The criteria for success or failure of the cell change order to GERAN are specified in TS 44.060[36].
5.4.3.4	Successful completion of the mobility from E-UTRA
Upon successfully completing the handover or the cell change order, the UE shall:
1>	perform the actions upon leaving RRC_CONNECTED as specified in 5.3.12, with release cause ‘other’;
1>	stop timer T304, if running;
5.4.3.5	Mobility from E-UTRA failure
The UE shall:
1>	if T304 expires (mobility from E-UTRA failure); or
1>	if the UE does not succeed in establishing the connection to the target radio access technology; or
1>	if the UE is unable to comply with (part of) the configuration included in the MobilityFromEUTRACommand message; or
1>	if there is a protocol error in the inter RAT information included in the MobilityFromEUTRACommand message, causing the UE to fail the procedure according to the specifications applicable for the target RAT:
2>	stop T304, if running;
2>	if the cs-FallbackIndicator in the MobilityFromEUTRACommand message was set to ‘TRUE’:
3>	 indicate to upper layers that the CS Fallback procedure has failed;
2>	revert back to the configuration used in the source cell, excluding the configuration configured by the physicalConfigDedicated, mac-MainConfig and sps-Config;
2>	initiate the connection re-establishment procedure as specified in 5.3.7;
5.4.4	Handover from E-UTRA preparation request (CDMA2000)
5.4.4.1	General

Figure 5.4.4.1-1: Handover from E-UTRA preparation request
The purpose of this procedure is to trigger the UE to prepare for handover to CDMA2000 by requesting a connection with this network. This procedure applies to CDMA2000 capable UEs only.
The handover from E-UTRA preparation request procedure applies when signalling radio bearers are established.
5.4.4.2	Initiation
E-UTRAN initiates the handover from E-UTRA preparation request procedure to a UE in RRC_CONNECTED, possibly in response to a MeasurementReport message, by sending a HandoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest message. E-UTRA initiates the procedure only when AS security has been activated.
5.4.4.3	Reception of the HandoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest by the UE
Upon reception of the HandoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest message, the UE shall:
1>	indicate the request to prepare handover and forward the cdma2000-Type to the CDMA2000 upper layers;
1>	if cdma2000-Type is set to ‘type1XRTT’:
2>	forward the rand and the mobilityParametersCDMA2000 to the CDMA2000 upper layers;
5.4.5	UL handover preparation transfer (CDMA2000)
5.4.5.1	General

Figure 5.4.5.1-1: UL handover preparation transfer
The purpose of this procedure is to tunnel the handover related CDMA2000 dedicated information from UE to E-UTRAN when requested by the higher layers. The procedure is triggered by the higher layers on receipt of HandoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest message. This procedure applies to CDMA2000 capable UEs only.
5.4.5.2	Initiation
A UE in RRC_CONNECTED initiates the UL Handover Preparation Transfer procedure whenever there is a need to transfer handover related non-3GPP dedicated information. The UE initiates the UL handover preparation transfer procedure by sending the ULHandoverPreparationTransfer message.
5.4.5.3	Actions related to transmission of the ULHandoverPreparationTransfer message
The UE shall set the contents of the ULHandoverPreparationTransfer message as follows:
1>	include the cdma2000-Type and the dedicatedInfoCDMA2000;
1>	if the cdma2000-Type is set to ‘type1XRTT’:
2>	include the meid and set it to the value received from the CDMA2000 upper layers;
1>	submit the ULHandoverPreparationTransfer message to lower layers for transmission, upon which the procedure ends;
5.4.5.4	Failure to deliver the ULHandoverPreparationTransfer message
The UE shall:
1>	if the UE is unable to guarantee successful delivery of ULHandoverPreparationTransfer messages:
2>	inform upper layers about the possible failure to deliver the information contained in the concerned ULHandoverPreparationTransfer message;
5.4.6	Inter-RAT cell change order to E-UTRAN
5.4.6.1	General
The purpose of the inter-RAT cell change order to E-UTRAN procedure is to transfer, under the control of the source radio access technology, a connection between the UE and another radio access technology (e.g. GSM/ GPRS) to E-UTRAN.
5.4.6.2	Initiation
The procedure is initiated when a radio access technology other than E-UTRAN, e.g. GSM/GPRS, using procedures specific for that RAT, orders the UE to change to an E-UTRAN cell. In response, upper layers request the establishment of an RRC connection as specified in subclause 5.3.3.
NOTE:	Within the message used to order the UE to change to an E-UTRAN cell, the source RAT should specify the identity of the target E-UTRAN cell as specified in the specifications for that RAT.
The UE shall:
1>	upon receiving an RRCConnectionSetup message:
2>	consider the inter-RAT cell change order procedure to have completed succesfully;
5.4.6.3	UE fails to complete an inter-RAT cell change order
If the inter-RAT cell change order fails the UE shall return to the other radio access technology and proceed as specified in the appropriate specifications for that RAT.
The UE shall:
1>	upon failure to establish the RRC connection as specified in subclause 5.3.3:
2>	consider the inter-RAT cell change order procedure to have failed;
NOTE:	The cell change was network ordered. Therefore, failure to change to the target cell should not cause the UE to move to UE-controlled cell selection.
5.5	Measurements
5.5.1	Introduction
The UE reports measurement information in accordance with the measurement configuration as provided by E-UTRAN. E-UTRAN provides the measurement configuration applicable for a UE in RRC_CONNECTED by means of dedicated signalling, i.e. using the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message.
The UE can be requested to perform the following types of measurements:
-	Intra-frequency measurements: measurements at the downlink carrier frequency of the serving cell.
-	Inter-frequency measurements: measurements at frequencies that differ from the downlink carrier frequency of the serving cell.
-	Inter-RAT measurements of UTRA frequencies.
-	Inter-RAT measurements of GERAN frequencies.
-	Inter-RAT measurements of CDMA2000 HRPD or CDMA2000 1xRTT frequencies.
The measurement configuration includes the following parameters:
1.	Measurement objects: The objects on which the UE shall perform the measurements.
-	For intra-frequency and inter-frequency measurements a measurement object is a single E-UTRA carrier frequency. Associated with this carrier frequency, E-UTRAN can configure a list of cell specific offsets and a list of ‘blacklisted’ cells. Blacklisted cells are not considered in event evaluation or measurement reporting.
-	For inter-RAT UTRA measurements a measurement object is a set of cells on a single UTRA carrier frequency.
-	For inter-RAT GERAN measurements a measurement object is a set of GERAN carrier frequencies.
-	For inter-RAT CDMA2000 measurements a measurement object is a set of cells on a single (HRPD or 1xRTT) carrier frequency.
2.	Reporting configurations: A list of reporting configurations where each reporting configuration consists of the following:
-	Reporting criterion: The criterion that triggers the UE to send a measurement report. This can either be periodical or a single event description.
-	Reporting format: The quantities that the UE includes in the measurement report and associated information (e.g. number of cells to report).
3.	Measurement identities: A list of measurement identities where each measurement identity links one measurement object with one reporting configuration. By configuring multiple measurement identities it is possible to link more than one measurement object to the same reporting configuration, as well as to link more than one reporting configuration to the same measurement object. The measurement identity is used as a reference number in the measurement report.
4.	Quantity configurations: One quantity configuration is configured per RAT type. The quantity configuration defines the measurement quantities and associated filtering used for all event evaluation and related reporting of that measurement type. One filter can be configured per measurement quantity.
5.	Measurement gaps: Periods that the UE may use to perform measurements, i.e. no (UL, DL) transmissions are scheduled.
E-UTRAN only configures a single measurement object for a given frequency, i.e. it is not possible to configure two or more measurement objects for the same frequency with different associated parameters, e.g. different offsets and/ or blacklists. E-UTRAN may configure multiple instances of the same event e.g. by configuring two reporting configurations with different thresholds.
The UE maintains a single measurement object list, a single reporting configuration list, and a single measurement identities list. The measurement object list includes measurement objects, that are specified per RAT type, possibly including an intra-frequency object (i.e. the object corresponding to the serving frequency), inter-frequency object(s) and inter-RAT objects. Similarly, the reporting configuration list includes E-UTRA and inter-RAT reporting configurations. Any measurement object can be linked to any reporting configuration of the same RAT type. Some reporting configurations may not be linked to a measurement object. Likewise, some measurement objects may not be linked to a reporting configuration.
The measurement procedures distinguish the following types of cells:
1.	The serving cell.
2.	Listed cells - these are cells listed within the measurement object(s).
3.	Detected cells - these are cells that are not listed within the measurement object(s) but are detected by the UE on the carrier frequency(ies) indicated by the measurement object(s).
For E-UTRA, the UE measures and reports on the serving cell, listed cells and detected cells. For inter-RAT UTRA, the UE measures and reports on listed cells. For inter-RAT GERAN, the UE measures and reports on detected cells. For inter-RAT CDMA2000, the UE measures and reports on listed cells.
NOTE 1:	For inter-RAT UTRA and CDMA2000, the UE measures and reports also on detected cells for the purpose of SON.
NOTE 2:	This specification is based on the assumption that CSG cells of home deployment type are not indicated within the neighbour list. Furthermore, the assumption is that for non-home deployments, the physical cell identity is unique within the area of a large macro cell (i.e. as for UTRAN).
Whenever the procedural specification, other than contained in sub-clause 5.5.2, refers to a field it concerns a field included in the VarMeasConfig unless explictly stated otherwise i.e. only the measurement configuration procedure covers the direct UE action related to the received measConfig.
5.5.2	Measurement configuration

5.5.2.2	Measurement identity removal
The UE shall:
1>	for each measId included in the received measIdToRemoveList that is part of the current UE configuration in varMeasConfig:
2>	remove the entry with the matching measId from the measIdList within the VarMeasConfig;
2>	remove the measurement reporting entry for this measId from the VarMeasReportList, if included;
2>	stop the periodical reporting timer or timer T321, whichever one is running, and reset the associated information (e.g. timeToTrigger) for this measId;
NOTE:	The UE does not consider the message as erroneous if the measIdToRemoveList includes any measId value that is not part of the current UE configuration.
5.5.2.3	Measurement identity addition/ modification
E-UTRAN applies the procedure as follows:
-	configure a measId only if the corresponding measurement object, the corresponding reporting configuration and the corresponding quantity configuration, are configured;
The UE shall:
1>	for each measId included in the received measIdToAddModList:
2>	if an entry with the matching measId exists in the measIdList within the VarMeasConfig:
3>	replace the entry with the value received for this measId;
2>	else:
3>	add a new entry  for this measId within the VarMeasConfig ;
2>	remove the measurement reporting entry for this measId from the VarMeasReportList, if included;
2>	stop the periodical reporting timer or timer T321, whichever one is running, and reset the associated information (e.g. timeToTrigger) for this measId;
2>	if the triggerType is set to ‘periodical’ and the purpose is set to ‘reportCGI’ in the reportConfig associated with this measId:
3>	if the measObject associated with this measId concerns E-UTRA:
4>	start timer T321 with the timer value set to 1 second for this measId;
3>	else:
4>	start timer T321 with the timer value set to 8 seconds for this measId;

3>	stop the periodical reporting timer or timer T321, whichever one is running, and reset the associated information (e.g. timeToTrigger) for this measId;
NOTE:	The UE does not consider the message as erroneous if the measObjectToRemoveList includes any measObjectId value that is not part of the current UE configuration.
5.5.2.5	Measurement object addition/ modification
The UE shall:

5.5.3.1	General
The UE supports measurements using a reporting configuration with the purpose set to ‘reportCGI’, if the network provides sufficient idle periods.

3>	if the purpose for the associated reportConfig is set to ‘reportCGI’:
4>	perform the corresponding measurements of neighbouring cells on the frequencies and RATs indicated in the concerned measObject;
2>	perform the evaluation of reporting criteria as specified in section 5.5.4;
1>	if a measId is configuredfor which the purpose within the associated reportConfig is set to ‘reportCGI’:
2>	try to acquire the global cell identity of the cell indicated by the cellForWhichToReportCGI in the associated measObject by acquiring the relevant system information from the concerned cell;

where
Mn is the latest received measurement result from the physical layer;
Fn is the updated filtered measurement result, that is used for evaluation of reporting criteria or for measurement reporting;
Fn-1 is the old filtered measurement result, where F0 is set to M1 when the first measurement result from the physical layer is received; and
a = 1/2(k/4), where k is the filterCoefficent for the corresponding measurement quantity received by the quantityConfig;
2>	adapt the filter such that the time characteristics of the filter are preserved at different input rates, observing that the filterCoefficent k assumes a sample rate equal to 200 ms;
NOTE 1:	If k is set to 0, no layer 3 filtering is applicable.
NOTE 2:	The filtering is performed in the same domain as used for evaluation of reporting criteria or for measurement reporting, i.e., logarithmic filtering for logarithmic measurements.
NOTE 3:	The filter input rate is implementation dependent, to fulfil the performance requirements set in [16]. For further details about the physical layer measurements, see TS 36.133 [16].

5.5.5	Measurement reporting

Figure 5.5.5-1: Measurement reporting
The purpose of this procedure is to transfer measurement results from the UE to E-UTRAN.
For the measId for which the measurement reporting procedure was triggered, the UE shall set the measResults within the MeasurementReport message as follows:
1>	set the measId to the measurement identity that triggered the measurement reporting;
1>	set the measResultServCell to include the quantities of serving cell;
1>	if there is at least one applicable neighbouring cell to report:
2>	set the measResultNeighCells to include the best neighbouring cells up to maxReportCells in accordance with the following:
3>	if the triggerType is set to ‘event’:
4>	include the cells included in the cellsTriggeredList as defined within the VarMeasReportList for this measId;
3>	else:
4>	include the applicable cells for which the new measurement results became available since the last periodical reporting or since the measurement was initiated or reset;
NOTE:	The reliability of the report (i.e. the certainty it contains the strongest cells on the concerned frequency) depends on the measurement configuration i.e. the reportInterval. The related performance requirements are specified in TS 36.133 [16].
3>	for each cell that is included in the measResultNeighCells, include the physCellId;
3>	if the triggerType is set to ‘event’; or the purpose is set to ‘reportStrongestCells’ or to ‘reportStrongestCellsForSON’:
4>	for each included cell, include the layer 3 filtered measured results in accordance with the reportConfig for this measId, ordered as follows:
5>	if the measObject associated with this measId concerns E-UTRA:
6>	set the measResult to include the quantity(ies) indicated in the reportQuantity within the concerned reportConfig in order of decreasing triggerQuantity, i.e. the best cell is included first;
5>	else:
6>	set the measResult to the quantity as configured for the concerned RAT within the quantityConfig in order of decreasing quantity, i.e. the best cell is included first;
3>	else if the purpose is set to ‘reportCGI’:
4>	if the mandatory present fields of the cellGlobalId for the cell indicated by the cellForWhichToReportCGI in the associated measObject have been obtained:
5>	include the cgi-Info containing all the fields that have been successfully acquired;
1>	increment the numberOfReportsSent as defined within the VarMeasReportList for this measId by 1;
1>	stop the periodical reporting timer, if running;
1>	if the numberOfReportsSent as defined within the VarMeasReportList for this measId is less than the reportAmount as defined within the corresponding reportConfig for this measId:
2>	start the periodical reporting timer with the value of reportInterval as defined within the corresponding reportConfig for this measId;

5.5.6	Measurement related actions
5.5.6.1	Actions upon handover and re-establishment
E-UTRAN applies the handover procedure as follows:
-	when performing the handover procedure, as specified in 5.3.5.4, ensure that a measObjectId corresponding to the handover target carrier frequency is configured as a result of the procedures described in this sub-clause and in 5.3.5.4;
E-UTRAN applies the re-establishment procedure as follows:
-	when performing the connection re-establishment procedure, as specified in 5.3.7, ensure that a measObjectId corresponding to the target carrier frequency is configured as a result of the procedure described in this sub-clause and the subsequent connection reconfiguration procedure immediately following the re-establishment procedure;
The UE shall:
1>	for each measId included in the measIdList within VarMeasConfig:
2>	if the triggerType is set to ‘periodical’:
3>	remove this measId from the measIdList within VarMeasConfig:
1>	if the procedure was triggered due to inter-frequency handover or successful re-establishment to an inter-frequency cell, update the measId values in the measIdList within VarMeasConfig as follows:
2>	if a measObjectId value corresponding to the target carrier frequency exists in the measObjectList within VarMeasConfig:
3>	for each measId value in the measIdList:
4>	if the measId value is linked to the measObjectId value corresponding to the source carrier frequency:
5>	link this measId value to the measObjectId value corresponding to the target carrier frequency;
4>	else if the measId value is linked to the measObjectId value corresponding to the target carrier frequency:
5>	link this measId value to the measObjectId value corresponding to the source carrier frequency;
2>	else:
3>	remove all measId values that are linked to the measObjectId value corresponding to the source carrier frequency;
1>	remove all measurement reporting entries within VarMeasReportList;
1>	reset the periodical reporting timer or timer T321, whichever one is running, as well as associated information (e.g. timeToTrigger) for all measId;
1>	release the measurement gaps, if activated;
NOTE:	If the UE requires measurement gaps to perform inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements, the UE resumes the inter-frequency and inter-RAT measurements after the E-UTRAN has setup the measurement gaps.
5.5.6.2	Speed dependant scaling of measurement related parameters
The UE shall adjust the value of the following parameter configured by the E-UTRAN depending on the UE speed: timeToTrigger. The UE shall apply 3 different levels, which are selected as follows:
The UE shall:
1>	perform mobility state detection using the mobility state detection as specified in TS 36.304 [4] with the following modifications:
2>	counting handovers instead of cell reselections;
2>	applying the parameter applicable for RRC_CONNECTED as included in speedStatePars within VarMeasConfig;
1>	if high mobility state is detected:
2>	use the timeToTrigger value multiplied by sf-High within VarMeasConfig;
1>	else if medium mobility state is detected:
2>	use the timeToTrigger value multiplied by sf-Medium within VarMeasConfig;
   1>	else

1>	forward the rand and the mobilityParameters to the CDMA2000 1xRTT upper layers;
5.7	Generic error handling
5.7.1	General
The generic error handling defined in the subsequent sub-clauses applies unless explicitly specified otherwise e.g. within the procedure specific error handling.
The UE shall consider a value as not comprehended when it is set:
-	to an extended value that is not defined in the version of the transfer syntax supported by the UE.
-	to a spare or reserved value unless the specification defines specific behaviour that the UE shall apply upon receiving the concerned spare/ reserved value.
The UE shall consider a field as not comprehended when it is defined:
-	as spare or reserved unless the specification defines specific behaviour that the UE shall apply upon receiving the concerned spare/ reserved field.
5.7.2	ASN.1 violation or encoding error
The UE shall:
1>	when receiving an RRC message on the BCCH, PCCH or CCCH for which the abstract syntax is invalid:
2>	ignore the message;
NOTE	This section applies in case one or more fields is set to a code point not defined in this version of the transfer syntax. In this case, it may not be  possible to reliably detect which field is in the error hence the error handling is at the message level.
5.7.3	Field set to a not comprehended value
The UE shall, when receiving an RRC message on any logical channel:
1>	if the message includes a field that has a value that the UE does not comprehend:
2>	if a default value is defined for this field:
3>	treat the message while using the default value defined for this field;
2>	else if the concerned field is optional:
3>	treat the message as if the field were absent and in accordance with the need code for absence of the concerned field;
2>	else:
3>	treat the message as if the field were absent and in accordance with sub-clause 5.7.4;
5.7.4	Mandatory field missing
The UE shall:
1>	if the message includes a field that is mandatory to include in the message (e.g. because conditions for mandatory presence are fulfilled) and that field is absent or treated as absent:
2>	if the RRC message was received on DCCH or CCCH:
3>	ignore the message;
2>	else:
3>	if the field concerns a (sub-field of) an entry of a list (i.e. a SEQUENCE OF):
4>	treat the list as if the entry including the missing or not comprehended field was not present;
3>	else if the field concerns a sub-field of another field, referred to as the 'parent' field i.e. the field that is one nesting level up compared to the erroneous field:
4>	consider the 'parent' field to be set to a not comprehended value;
4>	apply the generic error handling to the subsequent 'parent' field(s), until reaching the top nesting level i.e. the message level;
3>	else (field at message level):
4>	ignore the message;
NOTE:	The error handling defined in these sub-clauses implies that the UE ignores a message with the message type or version set to a not comprehended value.
5.7.5	Not comprehended field
The UE shall, when receiving an RRC message on any logical channel:
1>	if the message includes a field that the UE does not comprehend:
2>	treat the rest of the message as if the field was absent;
NOTE:	This section does not apply to the case of an extension to the value range of a field.  Such cases are addressed instead by the requirements in section 5.7.3.
6	Protocol data units, formats and parameters (tabular & ASN.1)
6.1	General
The contents of each RRC message is specified in sub-clause 6.2 using ASN.1 to specify the message syntax and using tables when needed to provide further detailed information about the information elements specified in the message syntax. The syntax of the information elements that are defined as stand-alone abstract types is further specified in a similar manner in sub-clause 6.3.
The need for information elements to be present in a message or an abstract type, i.e., the ASN.1 fields that are specified as OPTIONAL in the abstract notation (ASN.1), is specified by means of comment text tags attached to the OPTIONAL statement in the abstract syntax. All comment text tags are available for use in the downlink direction only. The meaning of each tag is specified in table 6.1-1.
Table 6.1-1: Meaning of abbreviations used to specify the need for information elements to be present
AbbreviationMeaningCond conditionTag
(Used in downlink only)Conditionally present
An information element for which the need is specified by means of conditions. For each conditionTag, the need is specified in a tabular form following the ASN.1 segment. In case, according to the conditions, a field is not present, the UE takes no action and where applicable shall continue to use the existing value (and/ or the associated functionality) unless explicitly stated otherwise in the description of the field itself.Need OP
(Used in downlink only) Optionally present
An information element that is optional to signal. For downlink messages, the UE is not required to take any special action on absence of the IE beyond what is specified in the procedural text or the field description table following the ASN.1 segment. The UE behaviour on absence should be captured either in the procedural text or in the field description.Need ON
(Used in downlink only)Optionally present, No action
An information element that is optional to signal. If the message is received by the UE, and in case the information element is absent, the UE takes no action and where applicable shall continue to use the existing value (and/ or the associated functionality).Need OR
(Used in downlink only) Optionally present, Release
An information element that is optional to signal. If the message is received by the UE, and in case the information element is absent, the UE shall discontinue/ stop using/ delete any existing value (and/ or the associated functionality).
Any IE with Need ON in system information shall be interpreted as Need OR.

Access class barring for mobile originating signalling.ac-BarringForMO-Data
Access class barring for mobile originating calls.ac-BarringFactor
If the random number drawn by the UE is lower than this value, access is allowed. Otherwise the access is barred. The values are interpreted in the range [0,1): p00 = 0, p05 = 0.05, p10 = 0.10,…,p95 = 0.95.ac-BarringTime
Mean access barring time value in seconds.ac-BarringForSpecialAC
Access class barring for AC 11-15. The first/ leftmost bit is for AC 11, the second bit is for AC 12, and so on.ul-CarrierFreq
For FDD: If absent, the (default) value determined from the default TX-RX frequency separation defined in TS 36.101 [42, table 5.7.3-1] applies.
For TDD: This parameter is absent and it is equal to the downlink frequency.ul-Bandwidth
Parameter: transmission bandwidth configuration, NRB, in uplink, see TS 36.101 [42, table 5.6-1]. Value n6 corresponds to 6 resource blocks, n15 to 15 resource blocks and so on. If for FDD this parameter is absent, the uplink bandwidth is equal to the downlink bandwidth. For TDD this parameter is absent and it is equal to the downlink bandwidth.mbsfn-SubframeConfigList
Defines the subframes that are reserved for MBSFN in downlink.radioFrameAllocationPeriod, radioFrameAllocationOffset
Radio-frames that contain MBSFN subframes occur when equation SFN mod radioFrameAllocationPeriod = radioFrameAllocationOffset is satisfied. Value n1 for radioframeAllocationPeriod denotes value 1, n2 denotes value 2, and so on. When fourFrames is used for subframeAllocation, the equation defines the first radio frame referred to in the description below. Values n1 and n2 are not applicable when fourFrames is used.subframeAllocation
Defines the subframes that are allocated for MBSFN within the radio frame allocation period defined by the radioFrameAllocationPeriod and the radioFrameAllocationOffset.oneFrame
“1” denotes that the corresponding subframe is allocated for MBSFN. The following mapping applies:
FDD: The first/leftmost bit defines the MBSFN allocation for subframe #1, the second bit for #2, third bit for #3 , fourth bit for #6, fifth bit for #7, sixth bit for #8.
TDD: The first/leftmost bit defines the allocation for subframe #3, the second bit for #4, third bit for #7, fourth bit for #8, fifth bit for #9. Uplink subframes are not allocated. The last bit is not used.fourFrames
A bit-map indicating MBSFN subframe allocation in four consecutive radio frames, “1” denotes that the corresponding subframe is allocated for MBSFN. The bitmap is interpreted as follows:
FDD: Starting from the first radioframe and from the first/leftmost bit in the bitmap, the allocation applies to subframes #1, #2, #3 , #6, #7, and #8 in the sequence of the four radio-frames.
TDD: Starting from the first radioframe and from the first/leftmost bit in the bitmap, the allocation applies to subframes #3, #4, #7, #8, and #9 in the sequence of the four radio-frames. The last four bits are not used. Uplink subframes are not allocated.

The sixth octet of this octet string contains octet 1 of the value part of Mobile station classmark 3, the seventh of octet of this octet string contains octet 2 of the value part of Mobile station classmark 3 and so on. Note.
For GERAN PS: the encoding of UE capabilities is formatted as 'V' and is coded in the same way as the value part in the MS Radio Access Capability information element in TS 36.306 [5].
For CDMA2000-1XRTT: the octet string contains the A21 Mobile Subscription Information and the encoding of this is defined in A.S0008 [33]. The A21 Mobile Subscription Information contains the supported CDMA2000 1xRTT band class and band sub-class information.NOTE:	The value part is specified by means of CSN.1, which encoding results in a bit string, to which final padding may be appended up to the next octet boundary TS 24.008 [49]. The first/ leftmost bit of the CSN.1 bit string is placed in the first/ leftmost/ most significant bit of the first octet. This continues until the last bit of the CSN.1 bit string, which is placed in the last/ rightmost/ least significant bit of the last octet.

8	Protocol data unit abstract syntax
8.1	General
The RRC PDU contents in clause 6 and clause 10 are described using abstract syntax notation one (ASN.1) as specified in ITU-T Rec. X.680 [13] and X.681 [14]. Transfer syntax for RRC PDUs is derived from their ASN.1 definitions by use of Packed Encoding Rules, unaligned as specified in ITU-T Rec. X.691 [15].
The following encoding rules apply in addition to what has been specified in X.691:
-	When a bit string value is placed in a bit-field as specified in 15.6 to 15.11 in X.691, the leading bit of the bit string value shall be placed in the leading bit of the bit-field, and the trailing bit of the bit string value shall be placed in the trailing bit of the bit-field.
NOTE:	The terms 'leading bit' and 'trailing bit' are defined in ITU-T Rec. X.680. When using the 'bstring' notation, the leading bit of the bit string value is on the left, and the trailing bit of the bit string value is on the right.
8.2	Structure of encoded RRC messages
An RRC PDU, which is the bit string that is exchanged between peer entities/ across the radio interface contains the basic production as defined in X.691.
RRC PDUs shall be mapped to and from PDCP SDUs (in case of DCCH) or RLC SDUs (in case of PCCH, BCCH or CCCH) upon transmission and reception as follows:
-	when delivering an RRC PDU as an PDCP SDU to the PDCP layer for transmission, the first bit of the RRC PDU shall be represented as the first bit in the PDCP SDU and onwards; and
-	when delivering an RRC PDU as an RLC SDU to the RLC layer for transmission, the first bit of the RRC PDU shall be represented as the first bit in the RLC SDU and onwards; and
-	upon reception of an PDCP SDU from the PDCP layer, the first bit of the PDCP SDU shall represent the first bit of the RRC PDU and onwards; and
-	upon reception of an RLC SDU from the RLC layer, the first bit of the RLC SDU shall represent the first bit of the RRC PDU and onwards.
8.3	Basic production
The 'basic production' is obtained by applying UNALIGNED PER to the abstract syntax value (the ASN.1 description) as specified in X.691. It always contains a multiple of 8 bits.
8.4	Extension
The following rules apply with respect to the use of protocol extensions:
-	A transmitter compliant with this version of the specification shall, unless explicitly indicated otherwise on a PDU type basis, set the extension part empty. Transmitters compliant with a later version may send non-empty extensions;
-	A transmitter compliant with this version of the specification shall set spare bits to zero;
8.5	Padding
If the encoded RRC message does not fill a transport block, the RRC layer shall add padding bits. This applies to PCCH and BCCH.
Padding bits shall be set to 0 and the number of padding bits is a multiple of 8.

10	Radio information related interactions between network nodes
10.1	General
This section specifies RRC messages that are transferred between network nodes. These RRC messages may be transferred to or from the UE via another Radio Access Technology. Consequently, these messages have similar characteristics as the RRC messages that are transferred across the E-UTRA radio interface, i.e. the same transfer syntax and protocol extension mechanisms apply.
10.2	Inter-node RRC messages 
10.2.1	General
This section specifies RRC messages that are sent either across the X2- or the S1-interface, either to or from the eNB, i.e. a single ‘logical channel’ is used for all RRC messages transferred across network nodes. The information could originate from or be destined for another RAT.

Annex A (informative):
Guidelines, mainly on use of ASN.1
Editor’s note	No agreements have been reached concerning the extension of RRC PDUs so far. Any statements in this section about the protocol extension mechanism should be considered as FFS.
A.1	Introduction
The following clauses contain guidelines for the specification of RRC protocol data units (PDUs) with ASN.1.
A.2	Procedural specification
A.2.1	General principles
The procedural specification provides an overall high level description regarding the UE behaviour in a particular scenario.
It should be noted that most of the UE behaviour associated with the reception of a particular field is covered by the applicable parts of the PDU specification. The procedural specification may also include specific details of the UE behaviour upon reception of a field, but typically this should be done only for cases that are not easy to capture in the PDU section e.g. general actions, more complicated actions depending on the value of multiple fields.
Likewise, the procedural specification need not specify the UE requirements regarding the setting of fields within the messages that are send to E-UTRAN i.e. this may also be covered by the PDU specification.
A.2.2	More detailed aspects
The following more detailed conventions should be used:
-	Bullets:
-	Capitals should be used in the same manner as in other parts of the procedural text i.e. in most cases no capital applies since the bullets are part of the sentence starting with 'The UE shall:'
-	All bullets, including the last one in a sub-clause, should end with a semi-colon i.e. an ';'
-	Conditions
-	Whenever multiple conditions apply, a semi-colon should be used at the end of each conditions with the exception of the last one, i.e. as in 'if cond1; or cond2: 
A.3	PDU specification
A.3.1	General principles
A.3.1.1	ASN.1 sections
The RRC PDU contents are formally and completely described using abstract syntax notation (ASN.1), see X.680 [13], X.681 (02/2002) [14].
The complete ASN.1 code is divided into a number of ASN.1 sections in the specifications. In order to facilitate the extraction of the complete ASN.1 code from the specification, each ASN.1 section begins with a text paragraph consisting entirely of an ASN.1 start tag, which consists of a double hyphen followed by a single space and the text string "ASN1START" (in all upper case letters). Each ASN.1 section ends with a text paragraph consisting entirely of an ASN.1 stop tag, which consists of a double hyphen followed by a single space and the text "ASN1STOP" (in all upper case letters):
-- ASN1START

-- ASN1STOP

The text paragraphs containing the ASN.1 start and stop tags should not contain any ASN.1 code significant for the complete description of the RRC PDU contents. The complete ASN.1 code may be extracted by copying all the text paragraphs between an ASN.1 start tag and the following ASN.1 stop tag in the order they appear, throughout the specification.
NOTE:	A typical procedure for extraction of the complete ASN.1 code consists of a first step where the entire RRC PDU contents description (ultimately the entire specification) is saved into a plain text (ASCII) file format, followed by a second step where the actual extraction takes place, based on the occurrence of the ASN.1 start and stop tags.
A.3.1.2	ASN.1 identifier naming conventions
The naming of identifiers (i.e., the ASN.1 field and type identifiers) should be based on the following guidelines:
-	Message (PDU) identifiers should be ordinary mixed case without hyphenation. These identifiers, e.g., the RRCConnectionModificationCommand, should be used for reference in the procedure text. Abbreviated forms of these identifiers should not be used.
-	Type identifiers other than PDU identifiers should be ordinary mixed case, with hyphenation used to set off acronyms only where an adjacent letter is a capital, e.g., EstablishmentCause, SelectedPLMN (not Selected-PLMN, since the “d” in “Selected” is lowercase), InitialUE-Identity and MeasSFN-SFN-TimeDifference.
-	Field identifiers shall start with a lowercase letter and use mixed case thereafter, e.g., establishmentCause. If a field identifier begins with an acronym (which would normally be in upper case), the entire acronym is lowercase (plmn-Identity, not pLMN-Identity). The acronym is set off with a hyphen (ue-Identity, not ueIdentity), in order to facilitate a consistent search pattern with corresponding type identifiers.
-	Identifiers that are likely to be keywords of some language, especially widely used languages, such as C++ or Java, should be avoided to the extent possible.
-	Identifiers, other than PDU identifiers, longer than 25 characters should be avoided where possible. It is recommended to use abbreviations, which should be done in a consistent manner i.e. use 'Meas' instead of 'Measurement' for all occurrences. Examples of typical abbreviations are given in table A.3.1.2.1-1 below.
-	For future extension: where versions of an ASN.1 field or type need to be distinguished by release, a suffix of the form "rX" is used, e.g., Foo-r9 for the Rel-9 version of the ASN.1 type Foo. If an ASN.1 field or type provides only the extension of a corresponding earlier field or type  (see sub-clause A.4), a suffix of the form "vXYZext" is used, e.g., AnElement-v10b0ext for the extension of the ASN.1 type AnElement introduced in the version 10.11.0 of the specification. Digits 0...9, 10, 11, etc. are used to represent the first digit of the version number. Lower case letters a, b, c, etc. are used to represent the second (and third) digit of the version number if they are greater than 9.
-	More generally, in case there is a need to distinguish different variants of an ASN.1 field or IE, a suffix should be added at the end of the identifiers e.g. MeasObjectUTRAN, ConfigCommon. When there is no particular need to distinguish the fields (e.g. because the field is included in different IEs), a common field identifier name may be used. This may be attractive e.g. in case the procedural specification is the same for the different variants.

AbbreviationAbbreviated wordConfConfirmationConfigConfigurationDLDownlinkFreqFrequencyIdIdentityIndIndicationInfoInformationMeasMeasurementNeighNeighbour(ing)Param(s)Parameter(s)PersistPersistentPhysPhysicalReestabReestablishmentReqRequestSchedSchedulingThreshThresholdTransmTransmissionULUplink
NOTE:		The table A.3.1.2.1-1 is not exhaustive. Additional abbreviations may be used in ASN.1 identifiers when needed.
A.3.1.3	Text references using ASN.1 identifiers
A text reference into the RRC PDU contents description from other parts of the specification is made using the ASN.1 field or type identifier of the referenced element. The ASN.1 field and type identifiers used in text references should be in the italic font style. The "do not check spelling and grammar" attribute in Word should be set. Quotation marks (i.e., " ") should not be used around the ASN.1 field or type identifier.
A reference to an RRC PDU type should be made using the corresponding ASN.1 type identifier followed by the word "message", e.g., a reference to the RRCConnectionRelease message.
A reference to a specific part of an RRC PDU, or to a specific part of any other ASN.1 type, should be made using the corresponding ASN.1 field identifier followed by the word "field", e.g., a reference to the prioritisedBitRate field in the example below.
-- /example/ ASN1START

LogicalChannelConfig ::=			SEQUENCE {
	ul-SpecificParameters				SEQUENCE {
		priority							Priority,
		prioritisedBitRate					PrioritisedBitRate,
		bucketSizeDuration					BucketSizeDuration,
		logicalChannelGroup					INTEGER (0..3)
	}		OPTIONAL
}

-- ASN1STOP

NOTE:	All the ASN.1 start tags in the ASN.1 sections, used as examples in this annex to the specification, are deliberately distorted, in order not to include them when the ASN.1 description of the RRC PDU contents is extracted from the specification.
A reference to a specific type of information element should be made using the corresponding ASN.1 type identifier preceded by the acronym "IE", e.g., a reference to the IE LogicalChannelConfig in the example above.
References to a specific type of information element should only be used when those are generic, i.e., without regard to the particular context wherein the specific type of information element is used. If the reference is related to a particular context, e.g., an RRC PDU type (message) wherein the information element is used, the corresponding field identifier in that context should be used in the text reference.
A reference to a specific value of an ASN.1 field should be made using the corresponding ASN.1 value while using quotation marks (i.e., " ") around the ASN.1 value, e.g., 'if the status field is set to value "true"'.
A.3.2	High-level message structure
Within each logical channel type, the associated RRC PDU (message) types are alternatives within a CHOICE, as shown in the example below.
-- /example/ ASN1START

DL-DCCH-Message ::= SEQUENCE {
	message					DL-DCCH-MessageType
}

DL-DCCH-MessageType ::= CHOICE {
	c1						CHOICE {
		dlInformationTransfer					DLInformationTransfer,
		handoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest		HandoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest,
		mobilityFromEUTRACommand				MobilityFromEUTRACommand,
		rrcConnectionReconfiguration			RRCConnectionReconfiguration,
		rrcConnectionRelease					RRCConnectionRelease,
		securityModeCommand						SecurityModeCommand,
		ueCapabilityEnquiry						UECapabilityEnquiry,
		spare1 NULL
	},
	messageClassExtension	SEQUENCE {}
}

-- ASN1STOP

A nested two-level CHOICE structure is used, where the alternative PDU types are alternatives within the inner level c1 CHOICE.
Spare alternatives (i.e., spare1 in this case) may be included within the c1 CHOICE to facilitate future extension. The number of such spare alternatives should not extend the total number of alternatives beyond an integer-power-of-two number of alternatives (i.e., eight in this case).
Further extension of the number of alternative PDU types is facilitated using the messageClassExtension alternative in the outer level CHOICE.
A.3.3	Message definition
Each PDU (message) type is specified in an ASN.1 section similar to the one shown in the example below.
-- /example/ ASN1START

RRCConnectionReconfiguration ::=	SEQUENCE {
	rrc-TransactionIdentifier			RRC-TransactionIdentifier,
	criticalExtensions					CHOICE {
		c1									CHOICE{
			rrcConnectionReconfiguration-r8		RRCConnectionReconfiguration-r8-IEs,
			spare3 NULL, spare2 NULL, spare1 NULL
		},
		criticalExtensionsFuture			SEQUENCE {}
	}
}

RRCConnectionReconfiguration-r8-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
	-- Enter the IEs here.
	...
}

-- ASN1STOP

Hooks for critical and non-critical extension should normally be included in the PDU type specification. How these hooks are used is further described in sub-clause A.4.
Critical extensions are characterised by a redefinition of the PDU contents and need to be governed by a mechanism for protocol version agreement between the encoder and the decoder of the PDU, such that the encoder is prevented from sending a critically extended version of the PDU type, which is not comprehended by the decoder.
Critical extension of a PDU type is facilitated by a two-level CHOICE structure, where the alternative PDU contents are alternatives within the inner level c1 CHOICE. Spare alternatives (i.e., spare3 down to spare1 in this case) may be included within the c1 CHOICE. The number of spare alternatives to be included in the original PDU specification should be decided case by case, based on the expected rate of critical extension in the future releases of the protocol.
Further critical extension, when the spare alternatives from the original specifications are used up, is facilitated using the criticalExtensionsFuture in the outer level CHOICE.
In PDU types where critical extension is not expected in the future releases of the protocol, the inner level c1 CHOICE and the spare alternatives may be excluded, as shown in the example below.
-- /example/ ASN1START

RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete ::= SEQUENCE {
	rrc-TransactionIdentifier			RRC-TransactionIdentifier,
	criticalExtensions					CHOICE {
		rrcConnectionReconfigurationComplete-r8
											RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete-r8-IEs,
		criticalExtensionsFuture			SEQUENCE {}
	}
}

RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete-r8-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
	-- Enter the IEs here. --														-- Cond condTag
	...
}

-- ASN1STOP

Non-critical extensions are characterised by the addition of new information to the original specification of the PDU type. If not comprehended, a non-critical extension may be skipped by the decoder, whilst the decoder is still able to complete the decoding of the comprehended parts of the PDU contents.
Non-critical extensions at locations other than the end of the message or other than at the end of a field contained in a BIT or OCTET STRING are facilitated by use of the ASN.1 extension marker "...". The original specification of a PDU type should normally include the extension marker at the end of the sequence of information elements contained.
Non-critical extensions at the end of the message or at the end of a field that is contained in a BIT or OCTET STRING are facilitated by use of an empty sequence e.g. as shown in the following example:
-- /example/ ASN1START

RRCMessage-r8-IEs ::= 					SEQUENCE {
	field1									InformationElement1,
	field2									InformationElement2,
	nonCriticalExtension					SEQUENCE {}						OPTIONAL	-- Need OP
}

-- ASN1STOP

The ASN.1 section specifying the contents of a PDU type may be followed by a field description table where a further description of, e.g., the semantic properties of the fields may be included. The general format of this table is shown in the example below. The field description table is absent in case there are no fields for which further description needs to be provided e.g. because the PDU does not include any fields, or because an IE is defined for each field while there is nothing specific regarding the use of this IE that needs to be specified.
%PDU-TypeIdentifier% field descriptions%field identifier%
Field description.%field identifier%
Field description.
The field description table has one column. The header row shall contain the ASN.1 type identifier of the PDU type.
The following rows are used to provide field descriptions. Each row shall include a first paragraph with a field identifier (in bold and italic font style) referring to the part of the PDU to which it applies. The following paragraphs at the same row may include (in regular font style), e.g., semantic description, references to other specifications and/ or specification of value units, which are relevant for the particular part of the PDU.
The parts of the PDU contents that do not require a field description shall be omitted from the field description table.
A.3.4	Information elements
Each IE (information element) type is specified in an ASN.1 section similar to the one shown in the example below.
-- /example/ ASN1START

PRACH-ConfigSIB ::=					SEQUENCE {
	rootSequenceIndex					INTEGER (0..1023),
	prach-ConfigInfo					PRACH-ConfigInfo
}

PRACH-Config ::=					SEQUENCE {
	rootSequenceIndex					INTEGER (0..1023),
	prach-ConfigInfo					PRACH-ConfigInfo					OPTIONAL	-- Need ON
}

PRACH-ConfigInfo ::=				SEQUENCE {
	prach-ConfigIndex					ENUMERATED {ffs},
	highSpeedFlag						ENUMERATED {ffs},
	zeroCorrelationZoneConfig			ENUMERATED {ffs}
}

-- ASN1STOP

IEs should be introduced whenever there are multiple fields for which the same set of values apply. IEs may also be defined for other reasons e.g. to break down a ASN.1 definition in to smaller pieces.
A group of closely related IE type definitions, like the IEs PRACH-ConfigSIB and PRACH-Config in this example, are preferably placed together in a common ASN.1 section. The IE type identifiers should in this case have a common base, defined as the generic type identifier. It may be complemented by a suffix to distinguish the different variants. The "PRACH-Config" is the generic type identifier in this example, and the "SIB" suffix is added to distinguish the variant. The sub-clause heading and generic references to a group of closely related IEs defined in this way should use the generic type identifier.
The same principle should apply if a new version, or an extension version, of an existing IE is created for critical or non-critical extension of the protocol (see sub-clause A.4). The new version, or the extension version, of the IE is included in the same ASN.1 section defining the original. A suffix is added to the type identifier, using the naming conventions defined in sub-clause A.3.1.2, indicating the release or version of the where the new version, or extension version, was introduced.
Local IE type definitions, like the IE PRACH-ConfigInfo in the example above, may be included in the ASN.1 section and be referenced in the other IE types defined in the same ASN.1 section. The use of locally defined IE types should be encouraged, as a tool to break up large and complex IE type definitions. It can improve the readability of the code. There may also be a benefit for the software implementation of the protocol end-points, as these IE types are typically provided by the ASN.1 compiler as independent data elements, to be used in the software implementation.
An IE type defined in a local context, like the IE PRACH-ConfigInfo, should not be referenced directly from other ASN.1 sections in the RRC specification. An IE type which is referenced in more than one ASN.1 section should be defined in a separate sub-clause, with a separate heading and a separate ASN.1 section (possibly as one in a set of closely related IE types, like the IEs PRACH-ConfigSIB and PRACH-Config in the example above). Such IE types are also referred to as 'global IEs'.
NOTE:	Referring to an IE type, that is defined as a local IE type in the context of another ASN.1 section, does not generate an ASN.1 compilation error. Nevertheless, using a locally defined IE type in that way makes the IE type definition difficult to find, as it would not be visible at an outline level of the specification. It should be avoided.
The ASN.1 section specifying the contents of one or more IE types, like in the example above, may be followed by a field description table, where a further description of, e.g., the semantic properties of the fields of the information elements may be included. This table may be absent, similar as indicated in sub-clause A.3.3 for the specification of the PDU type. The general format of the field description table is the same as shown in sub-clause A.3.3 for the specification of the PDU type.
A.3.5	Fields with optional presence
A field with optional presence may be declared with the keyword DEFAULT. It identifies a default value to be assumed, if the sender does not include a value for that field in the encoding:
-- /example/ ASN1START

PreambleInfo ::=					SEQUENCE {
	numberOfRA-Preambles				INTEGER (1..64)						DEFAULT 1,
	...
}

-- ASN1STOP

Alternatively, a field with optional presence may be declared with the keyword OPTIONAL. It identifies a field for which a value can be omitted. The omission carries semantics, which is different from any normal value of the field:
-- /example/ ASN1START

PRACH-Config ::=				SEQUENCE {
	rootSequenceIndex					INTEGER (0..1023),
	prach-ConfigInfo					PRACH-ConfigInfo					OPTIONAL	-- Need ON
}

-- ASN1STOP

The semantics of an optionally present field, in the case it is omitted, should be indicated at the end of the paragraph including the keyword OPTIONAL, using a short comment text with a need statement. The need statement includes the keyword "Need", followed by one of the predefined semantics tags (OP, ON or OR) defined in sub-clause 6.1. If the semantics tag OP is used, the semantics of the absent field are further specified either in the field description table following the ASN.1 section, or in procedure text.
A.3.6	Fields with conditional presence
A field with conditional presence is declared with the keyword OPTIONAL. In addition, a short comment text shall be included at the end of the paragraph including the keyword OPTIONAL. The comment text includes the keyword "Cond", followed by a condition tag associated with the field ("UL" in this example):
-- /example/ ASN1START

LogicalChannelConfig ::=			SEQUENCE {
	ul-SpecificParameters				SEQUENCE {
		priority							INTEGER (0),
		...
	}		OPTIONAL																	-- Cond UL
}

-- ASN1STOP

When conditionally present fields are included in an ASN.1 section, the field description table after the ASN.1 section shall be followed by a conditional presence table. The conditional presence table specifies the conditions for including the fields with conditional presence in the particular ASN.1 section.
Conditional presenceExplanationULSpecification of the conditions for including the field associated with the condition tag = "UL". Semantics in case of optional presence under certain conditions may also be specified.
The conditional presence table has two columns. The first column (heading: "Conditional presence") contains the condition tag (in italic font style), which links the fields with a condition tag in the ASN.1 section to an entry in the table. The second column (heading: "Explanation") contains a text specification of the conditions and requirements for the presence of the field. The second column may also include semantics, in case of an optional presence of the field, under certain conditions i.e. using the same predefined tags as defined for optional fields in A.3.5.
If the ASN.1 section does not include any fields with conditional presence, the conditional presence table shall not be included.
Whenever a field is only applicable in specific cases e.g. TDD, use of conditional presence should be considered.
A.3.7	Guidelines on use of lists with elements of SEQUENCE type
Where an information element has the form of a list (the SEQUENCE OF construct in ASN.1) with the type of the list elements being a SEQUENCE data type, an information element shall be defined for the list elements even if it would not otherwise be needed.
For example, a list of PLMN identities with reservation flags is defined as in the following example:
-- /example/ ASN1START

PLMN-IdentityList ::=				SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..6)) OF PLMN-IdentityList

PLMN-IdentityList ::=				SEQUENCE {
	plmn-Identity						PLMN-Identity,
	cellReservedForOperatorUse			ENUMERATED {reserved, notReserved}
}

-- ASN1STOP
rather than as in the following (bad) example, which may cause generated code to contain types with unpredictable names:
-- /bad example/ ASN1START

PLMN-IdentityList ::=					SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..6)) OF SEQUENCE {
	plmn-Identity							PLMN-Identity,
	cellReservedForOperatorUse				ENUMERATED {reserved, notReserved}
}

-- ASN1STOP
A.4	Extension of the PDU specifications
A.4.1	General principles to ensure compatibility
It is essential that extension of the protocol does not affect interoperability i.e. it is essential that implementations based on different versions of the RRC protocol are able to interoperate. In particular, this requirement applies for the following kind of protocol extensions:
-	Introduction of new PDU types (i.e. these should not cause unexpected behaviour or damage).
-	Introduction of additional fields in a PDUs (i.e. it should be possible to ignore uncomprehended extensions without affecting the handling of the other parts of the message).
-	Introduction of additional values of a field of PDUs. If used, the behaviour upon reception of an uncomprehended value should be defined.
It should be noted that the PDU extension mechanism may depend on the logical channel used to transfer the message e.g. for some PDUs an implementation may be aware of the protocol version of the peer in which case selective ignoring of extensions may not be required.
A.4.2	Critical extension of messages
The mechanisms to critically extend a message are defined in A.3.3. There are both "outer branch" and "inner branch" mechanisms available. The "outer branch" consists of a CHOICE having the name criticalExtensions, with two values, c1 and criticalExtensionsFuture. The criticalExtensionsFuture branch consists of an empty SEQUENCE, while the c1 branch contains the "inner branch" mechanism.
The "inner branch" structure is a CHOICE with values of the form "MessageName-rX-IEs" (e.g., "RRCConnectionReconfiguration-r8-IEs") or "spareX", with the spare values having type NULL.  The "-rX-IEs" structures contain the complete structure of the message IEs for the appropriate release; i.e., the critical extension branch for the Rel-10 version of a message includes all Rel-8 and Rel-9 fields (that are not obviated in the later version), rather than containing only the additional Rel-10 fields.
The following guidelines may be used when deciding which mechanism to introduce for a particular message, i.e. only an 'outer branch', or an 'outer branch' in combination with an 'inner branch' including a certain number of spares:
-	For certain messages, e.g. initial uplink messages, messages transmitted on a broadcast channel, critical extension may not be applicable.
-	An outer branch may be sufficient for messages not including any fields.
-	The number of spares within inner branch should reflect the likelihood that the message will be critically extended in future releases (since each release with a critical extension for the message consumes one of the spare values). The estimation of the critical extension likelyhood may be based on the number, size and changeability of the fields included in the message.
-	In messages where an inner branch extension mechanism is available, all spare values of the inner branch should be used before any critical extensions are added using the outer branch.
A.4.3	Non-critical extension of messages
The mechanisms to extend a message in a non-critical manner are defined in A.3.3. W.r.t. the use of extension markers, the following additional guidelines apply:
-	The extension marker ("…") is the primary non-critical extension mechanism that is used unless a length determinant is not required. Examples of cases where a length determinant is not required:
-	at the end of a message,
-	at the end of a structure contained in a BIT STRING or OCTET STRING
-	Extension markers within SEQUENCE
-	Extension markers are primarily, but not exclusively, introduced at the higher nesting levels
-	Extension markers are introduced for a SEQUENCE comprising several fields as well as for information elements which extension would result in complex structures without it (e.g. re-introducing another list)
-	Extension markers are introduced to make it possible to maintain important information structures e.g. parameters relevant for one particular RAT
-	Extension markers are also used for size critical messages (i.e. messages on BCCH, PCCH and CCCH), although introduced somewhat more carefully
-	Extension markers within ENUMERATED
-	Spare values are used until the number of values reaches the next power of 2, while the extension marker caters for extension beyond that limit
-	Extension markers within CHOICE:
-	Extension markers are introduced when extension is foreseen and when comprehension is not required by the receiver i.e. a behaviour is defined for the case where the receiver cannot comprehend the extended value (e.g. ignoring an optional CHOICE field)
There are no additional guidelines w.r.t. the use of non-critical extensions at the end of a message/ of a field contained in an OCTET or BIT STRING.
A.5	Guidelines regarding inclusion of transaction identifiers in RRC messages
The following rules provide guidance on which messages should include a Transaction identifier
1:	DL messages on CCCH that move UE to RRC-Idle should not include the RRC transaction identifier.
2:	All network initiated DL messages by default should include the RRC transaction identifier.
3:	All UL messages that are direct response to a DL message with an RRC Transaction identifier should include the RRC Transaction identifier.
4:	All UL messages that require a direct DL response message should include an RRC transaction identifier.
5:	All UL messages that are not in response to a DL message nor require a corresponding response from the network should not include the RRC Transaction identifier.
A.6	Protection of RRC messages (informative)
The following list provides information which messages can be sent (unprotected) prior to security activation and which messages can be sent unprotected after security activation.
P…Messages that can be sent (unprotected) prior to security activation
A - I…Messages that can be sent without integrity protection after security activation

A.7	Miscellaneous
The following miscellaneous conventions should be used:
-	References: Whenever another specification is referenced, the specification number and optionally the relevant subclause, table or figure, should be indicated in addition to the pointer to the References section e.g. as follows: 'see TS 36.212 [22, 5.3.3.1.6]'.
Annex B (normative): Release 8 AS feature handling
B.1	Feature group indicators
This annex contains the definitions of the bits in field featureGroupIndicators. 
In this release of the protocol, the UE shall include the field featureGroupIndicators in the IE UE-EUTRA-Capability. For a specific indicator, if all functionalities for a feature group listed in Table B.1-1 have been implemented and tested, the UE shall set the indicator as one (1), else (i.e. if any one of the functionalities in a feature group listed in Table B.1-1, which have not been implemented or tested), the UE shall set the indicator as zero (0).
The UE shall set all indicators, which do not have a definition in the table B.1-1, as zero.
If the optional field featureGroupIndicators is not included by UE supporting future release, the network may assume that UE supports all features listed in Table B.1-1 and deployed in the network.

Clarification for mobility from EUTRAN and inter-frequency handover within EUTRAN
There are several feature groups related to mobility from E-UTRAN and inter-frequency handover within EUTRAN. The description of these features is based on the assumption that we have 5 main “functions” related to mobility from E-UTRAN:
A.	 Support of measurements and cell reselection procedure in idle mode
B.	 Support of RRC release with redirection procedure in connected mode
C.	 Support of Network Assisted Cell Change in connected mode
D.	 Support of measurements and reporting in connected mode
E.	 Support of handover procedure in connected mode
All functions can be applied for mobility to Inter-frequency to EUTRAN, GERAN, UTRAN, CDMA2000 HRPD and CDMA2000 1xRTT except for function C) which is only applicable for mobility to GERAN. Table B.1-2 below summarises the mobility functions that are supported based on the UE capability signaling (band support) and the setting of the feature group support indicators.

Note that the measurements and reporting function (D) is distinct from the redirection (B), CCO (C) and handover (E) functions. In case measurements and reporting function is not supported, the network may still issue the mobility procedures in a blind fashion.
B.2	CSG support
In this release of the protocol, it is mandatory for the UE to support a minimum set of CSG functionality consisting of:
-	Identifying whether a cell is CSG or not;
-	Ignoring CSG cells in cell selection/reselection.
Additional CSG functionality in AS, i.e. the requirement to detect and camp on CSG cells when the "allowed CSG list" is available or when manual CSG selection is triggered by the user, are related to the corresponding NAS features. This additional AS functionality consists of:
-	Manual CSG selection;
-	Autonomous CSG search;
-	Implicit priority handling for cell reselection with CSG cells.
It is possible that this additional CSG functionality in AS is not supported or tested in early UE implementations.
Note that since the above AS features relate to idle mode operations, the capability support is not signalled to the network. For these reasons, no “feature group indicator” is assigned to this feature to indicate early support in Rel-8.
