.SH NAME
mip6d.conf \- MIPL Mobile IPv6 and NEMO Configuration file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B %etc%/mip6d.conf
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
MIPL Mobile IPv6 and NEMO daemon's configuration file
.P
Below is a list of currently supported configuration options. All
configuration lines are terminated with a semicolon.  Sub-sections are
enclosed in '{' and '}'.  Strings are quoted with double quotes.

.SH COMMON OPTIONS

The file contains the following common definitions:
.TP
.BR "include " """<pattern>"""

Includes content from other files based on provided pattern. Usual shell
wildcards are supported ('?', '*', '['). See man (7) glob for details. The
number of included files is virtually unlimited but only five levels of
recursion are authorized to prevent loops. Note that if given pattern
does not match any file, a simple warning is issued but parsing continues.
Unlike most configuration statements, no ';' is expected after the pattern.

Example: include "/etc/mip6d.conf.d/*.conf"


.TP
.BR "NodeConfig " "CN | HA | MN" ";"

Indicates if the daemon should run in Correspondent Node, Home Agent or
Mobile Node mode.

Default: CN

.TP
.BR "DebugLevel "  number ";"

Indicates the debug level of the daemon.  If the value is greater than
zero, the daemon will not detach from tty (i.e. debug messages will be
printed on the controlling tty).

Default: 0

.TP
.BR "DoRouteOptimizationCN " "boolean" ";"

Indicates if a node should participate in route optimization with a
Mobile Node.

Default: enabled

.TP
.BR "NonVolatileBindingCache " "boolean" ";"

This option is currently ignored.  Binding cache is always stored in
volatile memory, and is not retained between shutdown and startup.

.SH OPTIONS COMMON TO HOME AGENT AND MOBILE NODE

.TP
These options are used both in the Home Agent and Mobile Node:
.TP
.BR "Interface " "name" ";"
.TP
.nf
.BR "Interface " "name" " {"
.BR "	MnIfPreference " "number" ";"
.BR "	IfType " "CN | HA | MN" ";"
.BR "	Tunnel " "boolean" ";"
.B }
.fi

Specifies an interface and options associated with it.  If no options
are present, 
.B Interface
can be terminated with semi-colon.  This is used for home agent to
specify which interfaces are used for HA operation.  For the home
agent to function properly, a Router Advertisement daemon (e.g. radvd)
must broadcast advertisements with the Home Agent bit and Home Agent
Information Option set on these interfaces.  This option is also
used by multihomed Mobile Nodes to define which interfaces are used by
it. For MN and CN, it is posible to provide interfaces that are not
already available when the daemon is started. Those will be used when
available.

.B MnIfPreference
sets the interface preference value for an interface in a multi-homed
Mobile Node.  The most preferred interfaces have preference 1, the
second most preferred have 2, etc. Values between 0 and 10 are allowed.
A preference of zero means the interface will not be used.

The interface preference has a direct impact on the metric of default
routes configured by the daemon from RA information. Note that if two
interfaces with associated default routes have the same preference value,
the routes will end up having the same metric, except if different default
router preference (RFC 4191) values are provided in RA. In a sense,
MnIfPreference value value is the primary selector for interface and
default route selection and  default router preference value provided
in RA can then be used to break a tie.

Default: 10

.B IfType
overrides the default node behavior for this interface. If a MN doesn't
wish to use this interface for mobility, or a node doesn't act as HA on
this interface, the interface type should be set to CN.

Default: same as
.B NodeConfig

.B Tunnel

When enabled, this flag explicitly marks the interface as a tunnel
interface and modify the behavior of UMIP regarding the router
discovery, address configuration and route addition steps for the
interface. Those are expected to be done externally (manually or by
another automatic process (for instance when using a Teredo interface).
Note that the handling of routing via the interface is still partly
handled by UMIP but leaves some latitude to the user or the automatic
process that setup the interface. UMIP looks for default routes in the
main table that use the interface as output device and replaces them by
a default route with a proper preference. If a gateway was present for
the route (there is one for 6to4, but none when miredo is used), it is
kept in the new route. Other routes that are defined for the device
(including other default routes in other tables) are left untouched.

Limitations and details:

1) Tunnel interfaces are only allowed for MN and CN (not HA).

2) They are never considered as home link (i.e. you will never be at
home on a tunnel).

3) Unlike for physical interfaces, link detection is not reliable for
tunnel interfaces. If the tunnel interface state is directly dependent
of some physical interface link status, that status must be
monitored externally (i.e. not by UMIP) and reflected by having either
the interface being set down/up or address being removed/added for
UMIP to detect the change in interface configuration.

4) An address must be configured on the interface for it to be
selected. If no adress is available, UMIP will simply not consider the
interface at all (even if it provides a default route).

5) Routes that include specific sources are not considered by UMIP.

Example:

When using a teredo interface, the default route through the teredo
device is found and its preference changed. Link local routes are kept
unchanged. Address configuration is kept unmodified.

When using a 6to4 tunnel interface, a default route through the 6to4
device exists. It uses the 6to4 relay address (::192.88.99.1 anycast
address or another specific one) as gateway. UMIP finds this default
route and install a new default one with the same gateway but an
updated metric.

Default: disabled

.TP
.BR "UseMnHaIPsec " "boolean" ";"

Indicates if the MN-HA MIPv6 signalling should be protected with IPsec.

Default: enabled

.TP
.BR "KeyMngMobCapability " "boolean" ";"

If dynamic keying with MIPv6-aware IKE is used, this options should be
enabled.  It turns on the K-bit for binding updates and binding
acknowledgements.

Default: disabled

.TP
.nf
.BR "IPsecPolicySet {"
.BR "	HomeAgentAddress " "address" ";"
.BR "	HomeAddress " "address/length" ";"
.BR "	IPsecPolicy ..."
.BR "	...
.BR "}"
.fi

.B IPsecPolicySet
is a set of policies to apply for matching packets.  A policy set can
contain multiple
.B HomeAddress
options, but only one
.B HomeAgentAddress
option.  For home agent, home agent address field contains its own
address, and home address fields may contain any number of mobile
nodes for which the same policy applies.

.B IPsecPolicy
has the following format:

.TP
.BR "IPsecPolicy " "type " "UseESP" "number number" ";"

Field 
.B type 
can be one of HomeRegBinding, Mh, MobPfxDisc, ICMP, any, TunnelMh,
TunnelHomeTesting, or TunnelPayload.  The any option protects all
transport mode communication between the MN and HA.  Currently only
the ESP IPsec protocol is supported, but in the future AH and IPComp
might also be available.  The two remaining numeric fields are the
IPsec reqid values, the first one used for MN - HA, the second one for
HA - MN communication.  If just one value is defined, the same reqid
will be used in both directions.  If no reqid is given, reqid will not
be used.

If more that one IPsec transport mode or tunnel mode policy is defined
between the MN and HA in each direction, reqid can be used to provide
an unambiguous one-to-one mapping between IPsec policies and SAs.
Otherwise the policies will just share a common SA.

.SH HOME AGENT SPECIFIC OPTIONS

The following definitions are ignored unless the node is configured as a HA:

.TP
.BR "HaMaxBindingLife " "number" ";"

Limits the maximum lifetime (in seconds) for Mobile Node home registrations.

Default: 262140

.TP
.BR "SendMobPfxAdvs " "boolean" ";"

Controls whether home agent sends Mobile Prefix Advertisements to
mobile nodes in foreign networks.

.TP
.BR "SendUnsolMobPfxAdvs " "boolean" ";"

Controls whether home agent send unsolicited Mobile Prefix
Advertisements to mobile nodes in foreign networks.

.TP
.BR "MinMobPfxAdvInterval " "number" ";"

Sets a minimum interval (in seconds) for Mobile Prefix Advertisements.

Default: 600

.TP
.BR "MaxMobPfxAdvInterval " "number" ";"

Sets a maximum interval (in seconds) for Mobile Prefix Advertisements.

Default: 86400

.TP
.BR "HaAcceptMobRtr " "enabled | disabled" ";"

Indicates if the HA accepts Mobile Router bindings.

Default: disabled;

.TP
.BR "HaServedPrefix " "prefix/length" ";"

Prefix is an IPv6 prefix and length is the prefix length. Defines the whole
aggregated or extended prefix the HA serves. This option is only used for MR
bindings and is only needed if the MRs derive their Home Addresses from their
Mobile Network Prefixes, instead of one of the home link prefixes.

.TP
.BR "BindingAclPolicy " "address " "MNP-list " "allow | deny" ";"

Defines if a MN is allowed to register with the HA or not. The home address
of the MN is given in the address field.  The mobile network prefixes
belonging a NEMO Mobile Router are listed in the MNP list. The list can either
be an empty string or a comma separated list of network prefixes
enclosed in braces, for example:
.B "(3ffe:2620:6:3::/64, 3ffe:2620:6:4::/64)"

.TP
.BR "DefaultBindingAclPolicy " "allow | deny" ";"

Defines the default policy if no matching BindingAclPolicy entry is found for
a MN.

Default: allow

.SH MOBILE NODE SPECIFIC OPTIONS

The following definitions are ignored unless the node is configured as a MN:

.TP
.BR "MnMaxHaBindingLife " "number" ";"

Limits the maximum lifetime (in seconds) for Mobile Node home registrations.

Default: 262140

.TP
.BR "MnMaxCnBindingLife " "number" ";"

Limits the maximum lifetime (in seconds) for Mobile Node Correspondent
Node registrations.

Default: 420

.TP
.BR "MnDiscardHaParamProb " "boolean" ";"

Toggles if the Mobile Node should discard ICMPv6 Parameter Problem messages
from its Home Agent.  As the ICMPv6 error messages won't normally be protected
by IPsec, a malicious third party can quite easily impersonate the HA to the
MN.  Having the MN accept these messages therefore leaves it open to Denial
of Service attacks, even though its home registration signalling is protected
by IPsec.

Default: disabled

.TP
.BR "SendMobPfxSols " "boolean" ";"

Controls whether mobile node sends Mobile Prefix Solicitations to the
home network.

.TP
.BR "DoRouteOptimizationMN " "boolean" ";"

Indicates if the Mobile Node should initialize route optimization with
Corresponent Nodes.

Default: enabled

.TP
.BR "MnUseAllInterfaces " "enabled | disabled" ";"

Indicates if all interfaces should be used for mobility.  The preference
of these interfaces is always 1.  Unless you use dynamically created and
named network interfaces you should normally disable this option and use
.B Interface
options to explicitly list the used interfaces. 

Default: disabled

.TP
.BR "MobRtrUseExplicitMode " "enabled | disabled" ";"

Toggles between explicit or implicit mode home registrations in the MR.

Default: enabled

.TP
.BR "UseCnBuAck " "boolean" ";"

Indicates if the Acknowledge bit should be set in Binding Updates sent to
Corresponent Nodes.

Default: disabled

.TP
.BR "MnRouterProbes " "number" ";"

Indicates how many times the MN should send Neighbor Unreachability
Detection (NUD) probes to its old router after receiving a Router
Advertisement (RA) from a new one. If the option is set to zero or
the new router advertises a strictly higher default preference value
than the old one (as defined in RFC 4191), the MN will move to the new
router straight away.

Default: 0

.TP
.BR "MnRouterProbeTimeout " "decimal" ";"

Indicates how long (in seconds) the MN should wait for a reply during
a access router Neighbor Unreachability Detection probe.  If set, it
overrides any default Neighbor Solicitation Retransmit Timer value
greater than MnRouterProbeTimeout.  For example, if the interface
Retransmit Timer is 1 second, but MnRouterProbeTimeout is just 0.2
seconds, the MN will only wait 0.2 seconds for a Neighbor Advertisement
before proceeding with the handoff.

Default: 0

.TP
.BR "OptimisticHandoff " "enabled | disabled" ";"

When a Mobile Node sends a Binding Update to the Home Agent, no Route
Optimized or reverse tunneled traffic is sent until a Binding
Acknowledgement is received. When enabled, this option allows the
Mobile Node to assume that the binding was successful right after the
BU has been sent, and does not wait for a positive acknowledgement
before using RO or reverse tunneling.

Default: disabled;

.TP
.nf
.BR "MnHomeLink " "name " "{"
.BR "	HomeAddress " "address/length MNP list" ";"
.BR "	HomeAgentAddress " "address" ";"
.BR "	MnRoPolicy ..."
.BR "	..."
.BR "}"
.fi

Each 
.B MnHomeLink 
definition has a name.  This is the name (enclosed in double quotes)
of the interface used for connecting to the physical home link.  To
set up multiple Home Addresses on the Mobile Node, you need to define
multiple
.B MnHomeLink
structures.  The interface names don't have to be unique in these
definitions.  All the home link specific definitions are detailed below: 

.TP
.BR "HomeAddress " "address/length MNP list" ";"

Address is an IPv6 address, and length the prefix length of the
address, usually 64.  The MNP list contains the mobile network prefixes
belonging to that particular NEMO Mobile Router. The MNP list is of the
same format as in
.B "BindingAclPolicy."
This option must be included in a home link definition.

.TP
.BR "HomeAgentAddress " "address" ";"

Address is the IPv6 address of the Mobile Node's Home Agent. DHAAD is used
if it is the unspecified address ::.

Default: ::

.TP
.BR "IsMobRtr " "enabled | disabled" ";"

Defines if the MN is a NEMO MR.

Default: disabled

.TP
The route optimization policies are of the form:

.TP
.BR "MnRoPolicy " "address boolean" ";"

Any number of these policies may be defined. If no policies are defined default
behavior depends on the
.B DoRouteOptimizationMN
option.

The fields for a route optimization policy entry are as follows: 
.B address
defines the Correspondent Node this policy applies to, if left
undefined the uspecified address is used as a wildcard value 
.B boolean
sets route optimization either enabled or disabled for packets
matching this entry.
