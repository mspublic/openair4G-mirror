# this file contains the calibration values to compute the RSSI
# we can use three different gain stages (high, low, med) as well as a gain factor for fine tuning
# the three lines in this file gives the total rx gain in dB for the three gain stages if the rx gain is set to 30dB
# this is for Express MIMO2 without any additional RF frontend
# high gain
128 128 128 126
# med gain
122 123 123 120
# low gain (byp)
116 117 116 116
