ppp-2.2.0f-radclient.diff

        http://linux.slovenija.net/radius/

merit-2.4.21-CHAP.diff

	Patch to the Merit radiusd 2.4.21 to support the CHAP-Challenge
	attribute.  Doesn't work with earlier version of Merit radiusd. I sent
	this patch to Merit, so hopefully it'll be included in the next release.
	Apply this patch from the "src" directory of the radiusd sources.

radiusd-1.16.shadow.diff

	Patch to the original radiusd by Livingston to recognize "*"
	as a special password to look for shadow passwords.
	Apply this patch from the "src" directory of the radiusd sources.


radiusd-1.16.accounting.diff

	The patch for Livingston's (now Lucent's) radiusd 1.16 fixes the
	accounting reply digest bug. When you've applied this patch to your
	RADIUS server you no longer need to compile radiusclient with
	--enable-radius-116. This patch was contributed by Tilman
	Mueller-Gerbes <tmg@suse.de>. Thanks, Tilman!

rename.patch

        The patch renames the library to radiusclient-ng (that means 
	radiusclient.h will be renamed to radiusclient-ng.h, libradiusclient.so
	to libradiusclient-ng.so and so on). This is useful if you want the
	original radiusclient library coexist on the same system with this
	version.
