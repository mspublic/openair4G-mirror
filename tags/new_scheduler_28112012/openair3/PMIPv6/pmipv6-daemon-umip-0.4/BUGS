Known issues in MIPL 2.0.2
------------------------

If you run into any of the issues below, don't bother reporting them
unless you can provide a fix, as we are already aware of them.

General issues
--------------

* There are some limitations to the use of IPsec together with MIPv6
  due to the design of the Linux IPsec implementation.  Read
  README.IPsec for more information.

Mobile Node issues
------------------

* Multihoming support hasn't been very thoroughly tested and should
  therefore be considered developmental code.  However, it is a lot
  more stable than in the Release Candidates.
