Archives in this directory contain static binaries, so any kind 
of run-time linkage error is not expected. Please let me know 
if you experience such an error, or any kind of unexpected behaviour.

LZMA archives can be extracted as follows,

tar xvfa SCOREF-MGMT-v1.0.4.tar.lzma

Not for all versions a binary is created when the change is 
subtle and/or documentation related. So please follow OpenAirInterface
SVN for most up-to-date version.

Note: Name has changed from IF.MGMT to SCOREF-MGMT from version 1.1.0 on.
