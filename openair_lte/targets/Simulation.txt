First, you must have all three openair SW directories, openair1, openair2 and openair3 at the same hierarchical level as this directory.

1. The following packages must be available on your system:

	- libxml2
	- asn1c and the LTE ASN1 files (for information on how to install this and generate the required files see the README file in openair2/RRC/LITE/MESSAGES) 

2. To test the installation type:
   make check
