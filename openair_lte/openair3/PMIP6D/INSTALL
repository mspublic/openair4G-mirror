X. System Requirements
-----------------------------------------

	UBUNTU linux distribution is a mandatory environment to run PMIP6D.
		
-----------------------------------------
1. Installation of SYSLOGs Servers on MAGs
-----------------------------------------

	1.1) Each MAG machine has to run a SYSLOG Server on it.
		So on each machine that you use as MAG, you have to install a SYSLOG server :
		Installation of the SOCKLOG package :
			$ apt-get install socklog

		Edit and change the Syslog server configuration :
			$ emacs /etc/syslog.conf 
				-> In this file, look for the line containing local7.info and chnage it to have this -> "local7.info   /var/log/cisco_ap.log"
			$ emacs /etc/default/syslogd
				-> You should have the option "-r" enabled for the SYSLOG Daemon. So be sure you have -> SYSLOGD= "-r"
			$ /etc/init.d/syslogkd restart
				-> We restart the syslog daemon to take into account the modifications we just did

	1.2) Each Access Point should have their Syslog client enabled.
		So on each Access Point you have, you have to do what follows :
		On the CISCO SERIES 1100 ACCESS POINT web interface, go to EVENT LOG, then to CONFIGURATION and then add the MAG IP Address on which the syslog server is running. 
			Access Point Web Interface (10.0.0.1) --> EVENT LOG --> CONF --> Put SYSLOG SERVER's IP ADDRESS 
		Restart the Access Point afterwards.

-----------------------------------------
2) XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
-----------------------------------------

	2.1) On some UBUNTU versions, you might have a problem of "config.h file not found". A simple symbolic link is enough to avoid this error.
		$ ln -s /usr/src/linux-source-`uname -r`/include/linux/autoconf.h /usr/src/linux-sources-`uname -r`/include/linux/config.h

	2.2) Radius Client compilation :
		In the direcotyr freeradiusclient-1.1.6/
			$ ./configure
			$ make
			$ make install

	2.3) One of the specificity of a PMIP Domain is that the Mobile Node should not be aware of its mobility inside the PMIP Domain.
		One of the way to achieve this is to copy the MAC Address of one of the MAG and duplicate it for all the MAG.
			It can easily be done under linux environment by typing :
				$ ifconfig ethX down //(with ethX corresponding to your interface)
				$ macchanger -m XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX ethX //(with XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX equals to your MAG1's MAC Address)
				$ ifconfig ethX up
			WARNING: you have to repeat it everytime you reboot the machine. We suggest you to place these commands in script automatically executed at the boot of the machine.
		Moreover, your Access Points should not add their MAC Address to the IP Packets that they forward. To do this, you should put your Access Points in a MASQUERADING mode. 
		
-----------------------------------------
3) PMIP6D Compilation
-----------------------------------------

	At the root of PMIP6D directory, execute :
		$ make
